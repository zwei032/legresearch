Kathy Castor \\n[chairwoman of the committee] presiding.\\n    Present: Representatives Castor, Bonamici, Brownley, \\nHuffman, McEachin, Escobar, Graves, Palmer, Carter, Miller, and \\nCrenshaw.\\n    Ms. Castor. The committee will come to order.\\n    Welcome to the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis \\nhearing on ``State Perspectives on Cutting Methane Pollution.''\\n    Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a \\nrecess of the committee at any time.\\n    And as a reminder, members participating in a hearing \\nremotely should be visible on the camera throughout the \\nhearing.\\n    For members participating in person, masks are optional.\\n    As with in-person meetings, members are responsible for \\ncontrolling their own microphones. Members can be muted by \\nstaff only to avoid inadvertent background noise.\\n    And as a reminder, statements, documents, or motions must \\nbe submitted to the electronic repository, to \\nsccc.repository@mail.house.gov.\\n    Finally, members or witnesses experiencing technical \\nproblems should inform the committee staff immediately.\\n    Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining \\nthis hybrid hearing.\\n    Before we begin, we are all deeply saddened by the loss of \\nour dear colleague Representative Sean Casten's daughter Gwen \\nyesterday. So I would like to ask for a moment of prayer or \\nsilent reflection to lift up Representative Casten and his \\nfamily.\\n    [Moment of silence.]\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you.\\n    So in the hearing today we will examine state perspectives \\non cutting harmful methane pollution from oil and gas \\ninfrastructure and how Federal standards, policies, and \\ninvestments can complement state initiatives.\\n    I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes for an opening \\nstatement.\\n    We are so excited today to have two distinguished guests \\nfor this important hearing. We are going to learn directly from \\nGovernor Michelle Lujan Grisham, one of our former colleagues, \\nthe Governor of New Mexico, and Governor Mark Gordon of \\nWyoming.\\n    Thank you both for being here to share your unique \\nperspectives on climate solutions.\\n    We often focus on carbon dioxide as the main driver of the \\nclimate crisis, but it is also critical that we address \\nmethane, the second-largest source of heat-trapping pollution. \\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas and is responsible for about \\n30 percent of global warming in the modern era. And while it \\nleaves the atmosphere faster than CO<INF>2</INF>, it traps 87 \\ntimes as much heat while it lingers.\\n    Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \\nurged us to work to reduce this super-pollutant. And while the \\nBiden administration, Congress, and many states have adopted \\npolicies to reduce methane pollution and energy waste, methane \\nlevels have jumped dramatically over the last decade and \\nemissions remain at the highest levels on record.\\n    Fortunately, there are cost-effective ways to dramatically \\nreduce methane pollution from the oil and gas sector, which \\nremains the largest industrial methane source in the United \\nStates.\\n    Fossil fuels were responsible for approximately 80 percent \\nof the increase in methane emissions between 2006 and 2017 \\nacross North America, according to an analysis from NASA and \\nStanford, and methane can escape at nearly every stage during \\nthe production, transmission, and distribution of oil and gas.\\n    And all of these leaks add up. Producers could have sold an \\nadditional 180 billion cubic meters of natural gas, the \\nequivalent of the entire European market, if all leaks from \\nglobal fossil fuel operations had been captured last year, \\naccording to the International Energy Agency.\\n    And according to a separate analysis by the IEA, the oil \\nand gas industry could slash its methane emissions in half at \\nno net cost just by deploying existing technologies.\\n    So taking these actions has broad support. Last year, we \\nvoted to require companies to regularly find and repair methane \\nleaks. Major oil and gas companies supported the measure--but \\nonly 12 House Republicans voted for it, unfortunately.\\n    Our friends across the aisle often call for expanding \\nproduction of natural gas as a solution to the climate crisis. \\nBut unless harmful methane pollution is addressed, the climate \\nimpacts of gas can be worse than the coal it may replace.\\n    Plugging methane leaks is low-hanging fruit, and it is good \\nfor producers' bottom line as well. And because of Putin's \\ninvasion of Ukraine, it is now a security imperative. Capturing \\nwasted methane could meet more than half of President Biden's \\nLNG commitment to Europe.\\n    Stopping energy waste will help both everyday Americans and \\nour allies abroad. It will also support good-paying jobs here \\nin America. Those jobs include plugging and remediating \\nabandoned wells, expanding leak detection and repair, and \\nincreasing maintenance and inspections.\\n    According to the BlueGreen Alliance, unleashing this \\npotential could create 50,000-plus jobs over the decade. \\nRepairing and replacing leaking natural gas distribution lines \\ncould create 300,000 more jobs.\\n    That win-win scenario is one of the reasons we invested \\n$4.7 billion to help states and Tribes plug and remediate \\nabandoned oil and gas wells in the Bipartisan Infrastructure \\nLaw.\\n    We also invested more for abandoned mine reclamation, for \\nnatural gas pipeline modernization, and to mitigate the \\nenvironmental risks of undocumented orphan wells.\\n    We are excited about the progress at the state level, \\nGovernors.\\n    New Mexico now requires regular and frequent leak detection \\nand repair, and a new measure will help eliminate routine \\nventing and flaring across that state.\\n    And in Wyoming, state officials stepped up after the Trump \\nadministration weakened Federal methane safeguards. They \\ncreated state-level emissions limits and required leak \\ndetection and repair on new and modified sources.\\n    But there is so much more to be done--and quickly--as the \\ncostly impacts of the climate crisis continue to grow and the \\nwindow to act to avoid the worst impacts is rapidly closing.\\n    We need robust Federal rules to find and repair leaks from \\nboth new and existing sources, including marginal wells, and we \\nneed to end routine venting and flaring, which wastes energy \\nand harms the public health.\\n    So we are looking forward to a robust discussion today.\\n    At this time, I will recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. \\nGraves, for a 5-minute opening statement.\\n    [The statement of Ms. Castor follows:]\\n\\n                Opening Statement of Chair Kathy Castor\\n\\n                AMERICA'S NATURAL SOLUTIONS: THE CLIMATE\\n\\n              BENEFITS OF INVESTING IN HEALTHY ECOSYSTEMS\\n\\n                             April 1, 2022\\n\\n                        As prepared for delivery\\n\\n    I'm excited to recognize our two distinguished guests for this \\nimportant hearing so we can learn from them: Governor Michelle Lujan \\nGrisham, of New Mexico, and Governor Mark Gordon, of Wyoming.

And methane can escape at nearly every \\nstage during the production, transmission, and distribution of oil and \\ngas. These leaks add up. Producers could have sold an additional 180 \\nbillion cubic meters of natural gas--the equivalent of the entire \\nEuropean gas market--if all leaks from global fossil fuel operations \\nhad been captured last year, according to the International Energy \\nAgency. And according to a separate IEA analysis, the oil and gas \\nindustry could slash its methane emissions in half at no net cost just \\nby deploying existing technologies.\\n    Taking these actions has broad support. Last year, we voted to \\nrequire companies to regularly find and repair methane leaks. Major oil \\nand gas companies supported the measure, but only 12 House Republicans \\nvoted for it. Our friends across the aisle often call for expanding \\nproduction of natural gas as a solution to the climate crisis, but \\nunless harmful methane pollution is addressed, the climate impacts of \\ngas can be worse than the coal it may replace.\\n    Plugging methane leaks is low-hanging fruit and it is good for \\nproducers' bottom line. And because of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, \\nit's now a security imperative as well. Capturing wasted methane could \\nmeet more than half of President Biden's LNG commitment to Europe. \\nStopping energy waste will help both everyday Americans and our allies \\nabroad. It will also support good-paying jobs across America. Those \\njobs include plugging and remediating abandoned wells, expanding leak \\ndetection and repair, and increasing maintenance and inspections. \\nAccording to BlueGreen Alliance, unleashing this potential could create \\n50,000-plus jobs over a decade. Repairing and replacing leaky natural \\ngas distribution pipelines could create 300,000 more.\\n    That ``win-win'' scenario is one of the reasons we invested $4.7 \\nbillion to help states and tribes plug and remediate abandoned oil and \\ngas wells in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We also invested more \\nfor abandoned mine land reclamation, for natural gas pipeline \\nmodernization, and to mitigate the environmental risks of undocumented \\norphaned wells.\\n    We're also excited about progress at the state level. New Mexico \\nnow requires regular and frequent leak detection and repair, and a new \\nmeasure will help eliminate routine venting and flaring across the \\nstate. And in Wyoming, state officials stepped up after the Trump \\nadministration weakened federal methane safeguards, creating state-\\nlevel emissions limits and requiring leak detection and repair on new \\nand modified sources.\\n    But there is so much more to be done--and quickly--as the costly \\nimpacts of the climate crisis continue to grow and the window to act to \\navoid the worst impacts is rapidly closing. We need robust federal \\nrules to find and repair leaks from both new and existing sources, \\nincluding marginal wells. And we need to end routine venting and \\nflaring, which wastes energy and harms public health.\\n    I look forward to today's discussion.\\n\\n    Mr. Graves. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    Madam Chair, today I would like to announce that my good \\nfriends and I have finally seen the light, that I am 100 \\npercent on board with you-all's efforts to move to renewable \\nenergy. I am going to switch parties and----\\n    Ms. Castor. You are in sync with most of America now. Thank \\nyou.\\n    Mr. Graves. So April Fool's.\\n    When I talked about switching--I know. Somebody is going to \\nchop that. Somebody is going to chop that.\\n    And just to finish my statement, when I was talking about \\nswitching parties, I am going to switch from the Saturday night \\nMardi Gras Ball to the Sunday night Mardi Gras Ball.\\n    And when I tell you I have seen the light, I do want to \\nclarify that. So we recently had the President, in fact, over \\nthe last 4 months announce that he is going to release a total \\nof 260 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \\nAccording to EIA, we have imported up to about 200,000 barrels \\na day of Russian oil. So you can do the math. The President is \\nsaying he is going to release a million barrels. Even if you \\nhad a refined product, then you are still significantly below \\nthat number. And to me, it verifies what we have expressed \\nconcern about previously is that the release of the Strategic \\nPetroleum Reserve, our emergency reserves, are actually to \\nmitigate for bad energy policy.\\n    Madam Chair, you just made reference to the Great American \\nOutdoors Act. And you are right. Congress did pass that, and I \\nknow there are a lot of people in this room that supported it. \\nBut I also want to remind you that every penny of that money \\nthat goes toward funding the national parks and wildlife \\nrefuges and our BLM lands and forests and it goes to the \\nmaintenance, backlog maintenance, every single penny of that is \\nderived from offshore energy production in the Gulf of Mexico.\\n    And so, over the past year, we have seen, just in one year, \\nwe have seen--and I can get the exact numbers but I was looking \\nat some numbers just a minute ago. We have seen a reduction of \\nover $1 billion, over $1 billion in revenue to the U.S. \\nTreasury that would go to fund the Great American Outdoors Act, \\nas well as funding things like coastal resiliency and hurricane \\nprotection in my home State of Louisiana.\\n    And so there is a relationship here. If we continue, as \\nthis administration has done, to say we are not going to \\nproduce any energy--we are not going to produce it, the only \\nadministration in modern history that has not had a single \\nlease sale for onshore or offshore energy in the United States, \\nand so you are having financial implications. It is causing \\nenvironmental concerns. It is making the people that we \\nrepresent in south Louisiana along the Gulf Coast more \\nvulnerable, because we are not making investments into \\nhurricane protection and coastal restoration at the same level \\nas we would. And it is going to be a downward trajectory.\\n    And so some say, well, look, I don't want to use oil and \\ngas. Well, even this administration's Energy Information Agency \\nsays we are going to have a 50-percent global increase, 50-\\npercent global increase in demand for energy, this \\nadministration's projections show an increase in oil and an \\nincrease in gas demand, as well as renewables and everything \\nelse we need to be doing. We have got to have a strategy moving \\nforward.\\n    Madam Chair, you just talked about American support and the \\nmajority of Americans. You know what the majority of Americans \\nhave said? 92 percent of Americans, 92 percent have said that \\nthey don't want to import foreign oil, that they don't want to \\nbring in oil from Russia. Yet this administration's policies \\nare actually making us more dependent upon foreign resources.\\n    So what did the President do yesterday? He just says, well, \\nwe are going to employ the Defense Production Act and we are \\ngoing to get these critical minerals. Well, just a few months \\nago, you actually banned critical minerals from being produced \\nin the United States.\\n    The Defense Production Act really is designed for three \\nthings. It is designed for national defense. It is designed to \\nrespond to disasters. It is designed to respond to terrorism. \\nIt is really unfortunate that we are in a situation where we \\nhave to employ the Defense Production Act to address terrorism \\nand disasters committed by our own administration.\\n    Look, we are talking about natural solutions today. And I \\nreally appreciate it. And I am looking forward to hearing from \\nwitnesses because I think, Madam Chair, this is an area where \\nwe agree.\\n    I am excited to have Congressman Bruce Westerman, the \\nRanking Member of the Natural Resources Committee, come in, in \\na little while. Bruce has been an incredible leader and very \\nwell-versed on natural solutions such as the role that trees \\ncan play in sequestering greenhouse gases. And as you may know, \\nhe has got this legislation, the Trillion Trees Act, that could \\nsequester up to 205 gigatons of carbon through that initiative.\\n    But we also have other things that we ought to be talking \\nabout, and that includes our farms. Some of the largest \\nlandholders in conservation in the United States are farms. \\nAnd, in fact, since 1948, their productivity has increased over \\n280 times, the productivity of our agriculture. And so that is \\nmore efficient farming, providing food to the United States and \\nthe world and at much more efficient rates, in fact, some of \\nthe most efficient production in the world. In fact, I think it \\nis the most productive in world.\\n    But we have additional opportunities to do better best \\npractices and employ better--I don't know how to say that; let \\nme try that again--employ best practices on a wider scale, and \\nI think we can resolve to working with our farmers, other \\nnatural solutions.\\n    And one other thing, Madam Chair, that I want to make \\nreference to that I think affects both of us is restoring or \\nprotecting our coastal areas, because when we have our coastal \\nareas erode and are lost, it results in the emissions of \\ngreenhouse gases. And, in fact, when I was working for the \\nState of Louisiana, we did one of the first clean development \\nmechanisms in the world relating greenhouse gas emissions to \\nwetlands restoration and protection. I think we have some \\nopportunities there as well.\\n    So I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. And I \\nyield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Now I want to welcome our witnesses.\\n    Today we will hear from experts on the importance of \\ninvesting in healthy and resilient habitats and communities. We \\nhave a great panel.\\n    Mr. Collin O'Mara is the President and Chief Executive \\nOfficer of the National Wildlife Federation.

Thank you, Chair Castor and Ranking Member \\nGraves, for holding this hearing and for having me, giving me \\nthe opportunity to testify before you all.\\n    To achieve net zero emissions, we are going to need to \\nreduce net greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. by about 6 \\ngigatons and, you know, domestically and about 44 gigatons \\naround the globe. We often think about natural climate \\nsolutions and natural solutions as a resilience play. But I \\nwant to talk today about how this could actually be--these \\ninvestments could actually be a quarter of the overall \\nsolution.\\n    They are kind of the ultimate win-win-win. They are a win \\non safety. They make communities more resilient. The healthy \\nforests are less likely to experience megafires, helping \\nwetlands and grasslands help reduce damage from hurricanes and \\ninland flooding. They are a win on carbon. They are a multiple-\\ngigaton solution for sequestering carbon.\\n    There are economic wins. They create a ton of good jobs, \\nabout more than 17 to 25 jobs per million dollars invested. \\nThey both direct restoration jobs, as well as supporting jobs \\non working landscapes in the outdoor economy.\\n    Number four, the fourth win is that they are--they make \\ncommunities healthier. For example, urban trees, you know, \\nfilter out pollution out of the air and the water. They reduce \\nurban heat island effects.\\n    And the fifth one is that there is this huge savings. They \\nsave a ton of money. Every dollar we spend on pre-storm \\ndisaster preparedness saves us $6 to $8 in avoided costs, and \\nthat is an incredible ROI that is a great way to reduce our \\nlong-term debt.\\n    Yet, despite all of this, climate conversations rarely \\nfocus as much on natural solutions as they do on technology. \\nAnd it is less than 5 percent of overall climate spending. And \\nwhen you consider that really the only emission reduction \\nstrategy that also provides resilience benefits that can cost-\\neffectively save lives, it even becomes more absurd that we \\ndon't focus on it more.\\n    You know, last year alone we had twenty climate-fueled \\ndisasters that caused at least $1 billion in damages. These \\ndisasters resulted in $145 billion of total damages and the \\ntragic loss of nearly 700 lives in the U.S. Now, imagine how \\nmany of those lives could have been saved. And, you know, when \\ndisasters, whether it is Hurricane Katrina or Sandy or Harvey \\nor Maria, or the horrific fires out West, I mean, they \\ndisproportionately affect communities of color, low-income \\ncommunities, frontline communities first and worst.\\n    Now when we think about natural climate solutions, we are \\ntalking about a few types of key systems. So we are talking \\nabout forests. We are talking about wetlands. We are talking \\nabout grasslands and shrublands. We are talking about coasts \\nand the marine environment.\\n    Healthy forests are less likely to burn uncontrollably. \\nRight? They help clean water. They help restore water. They \\nreduce drought conditions. They provide key habitat for \\nwildlife, and they serve as our greatest terrestrial carbon \\nsink. Wetlands and repairing corridors, the average acre of \\nwetlands can hold more than 1 million gallons of water, 1 \\nmillion gallons. I mean, the absorption capacity is huge. So, \\nwhen communities face a hurricane or a flash flood, those \\nwetlands reduce both the volume and the velocity of water, \\nprotecting all those either inland or downstream.\\n    Grasslands and shrublands, native grasses and shrubs have \\nlong, deep roots that sequester a lot of carbon, improve soil \\nhealth, reduce soil erosion, all of which helps reduce flooding \\nand improve productivity, especially when invasive plants like \\ncheatgrass and buffalo grass aren't allowed to spread and get \\nthat tender on the landscape.\\n    Coasts and marines also huge opportunities for resilience \\nin carbon abatement on living shorelines, planted dunes, tidal \\nwetlands, mangroves, kelp, seagrass, and other native \\nvegetation. Each of these systems can mean the difference \\nbetween life and death, homes in better standing, or \\ncommunities that are washed away, life that is carrying on or \\nlives that are upended.\\n    Now, fortunately, as Chair Castor said, over the last \\nseveral Congresses and thanks to many of you, we have made \\ngreat progress on natural climate solutions, especially \\nresilience. You know, we have gone from these niche products to \\nactually mainstream solutions. We have seen this in WRDA, the \\nFarm Bill, the Great American Outdoors Act, America's \\nConservation Enhancement Act.\\n    We have seen natural infrastructure prominently focused in \\ndisaster supplementals. We have seen it in enhancements to the \\nhazard mitigation programs. The Infrastructure and Jobs Act had \\nhistoric investments, and the reconciliation package had $105 \\nbillion proposed for restoration resilience. We can and must \\nbuild on these investments and do so in ways that leave no \\ncommunity behind and ensure that communities of color and \\nfrontline communities are never an afterthought ever again.\\n    Now the good news is there is a whole range of bipartisan \\nsolutions that are before you right now. I would argue that the \\nbiggest single action that Congress could take just for private \\ninvestment in natural solutions is replicating the success of \\nthe 45Q tax credit for carbon capture technology and with a \\ncomplementary credit that is actually focused on the \\nsequestration of carbon naturally.\\n    Sending a clear market signal that is predictable, \\naccessible, additional, permanent, and ecologically \\nappropriate, we could catalyze innovation and private \\ninvestment onto public-private Tribal lands, while providing \\npolicy parity for natural solutions and their technological \\ncounterparts.\\n    If you want more greater public investment in--through the \\nCongress and also reduce long-term debt, we could update the \\nway we budget these projects, the way we score these projects. \\nYou know, CBO right now score the dollar we spend on mitigation \\nwithout the fixed dollars in spending--in savings that we would \\nenjoy. And we are spending a lot on supplementals that, \\nfrankly, are kind of that pound of cure where the ounce of \\nprevention would have been a lot cheaper.\\n    We also need to continue to prioritize natural solutions in \\nthings like WRDA, things like the next Farm Bill, all the \\necological restoration programs, and not just like the estuary \\nprograms in the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake and the Delaware \\nbut coastal Louisiana, the Everglades, coastal communities up \\nand down the coast, and also the working waterways like the \\nMississippi, the Ohio, the Missouri, the Colorado, the Rio \\nGrande, some of the resources that don't get the attention.\\n    And, finally, I would be remiss, of course, if I didn't \\nmention the Recovering America's Wildlife Act and other great \\nefforts like the North American Grasslands Conservation Act, \\nWildlife Corridors Act. And hopefully there is a bipartisan \\npath on the Trillion Trees initiative.\\n    So these present a huge opportunity. And investing in \\nnatural infrastructure allows us to center the health and \\nsafety of people, as well as advancing our climate, \\nconservation, and economic goals. That is a pretty good win-\\nwin-win-win-win.\\n    Thanks for letting me be with you today.\\n    [The statement of Mr. O'Mara follows:]\\n\\n                 Written Testimony of Mr. Collin O'Mara\\n\\n            President and CEO, National Wildlife Federation\\n\\n   Hearing on ``America's Natural Solutions: The Climate Benefits of\\n\\n                   Investing in Healthy Ecosystems''\\n\\n           U.S. House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis\\n\\n                             April 1, 2022\\n\\nIntroduction\\n    Thank you, Chairwoman Castor, Ranking Member Graves, and members of \\nthe select committee for holding this hearing. Natural infrastructure \\nis a proven, life-saving, and fiscally responsible solution to \\nsequester carbon and protect communities from the increasingly severe \\neffects of the climate crisis in every state and territory.\\n    Healthy rivers, forests, grasslands, wetlands, shrublands, and \\nshorelines are each essential for resilient communities, carbon \\nsequestration, thriving populations of fish and wildlife, and a vibrant \\noutdoor economy. These natural systems also reduce the need for costly \\nstructural flood and storm damage reduction projects and improve the \\neffectiveness and resilience of other critical infrastructure assets. \\nAs we confront climate change and anticipate increasingly more frequent \\nand severe storms and weather events, it is essential that we consider \\nall tools at our disposal, including the use of natural systems to help \\nbuffer and protect communities.\\n    As we work to confront the immense threats that the changing \\nclimate poses to communities today, natural solutions are essential to \\nprotecting communities. Climate-fueled hurricanes, heatwaves, fires, \\nfloods, and storms are here and their impacts are very real. Last year \\nalone, there were 20 climate-fueled disasters that have each caused at \\nleast $1 billion in damages and collectively resulted in $145 billion \\nin damage and the tragic loss of 688 lives. Natural systems--ranging \\nfrom healthy forests to coastal wetlands and dunes to healthy \\nfloodplains--can mean the difference between life and death, homes \\nstill standing or a community washed away, life carrying on or lives \\nupended.\\n    Natural solutions that sequester carbon should also be central to \\nany plan to achieve net-zero emissions--and, through the right \\nincentives and investments, can account for more than 30 percent of the \\nemission reductions needed.\\n    Fortunately, over the past several Congresses, natural \\ninfrastructure has emerged as a bipartisan solution to the challenges \\nmillions of Americans are facing. We've seen supportive policies and \\nincreased investment through the Water Resources Development Act, the \\nFarm Bill, Storm Recovery Supplemental Appropriations, reform of Hazard \\nMitigation Programs, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, America's \\nConservation Enhancement Act, annual appropriations, and most \\nsignificantly, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. \\nAnd there are many more bipartisan opportunities to do even more.\\n    By continuing to leverage the protective value of nature, we can \\nimplement approaches that break the destructive and devastating cycle \\nof climate-fueled unnatural disasters. Resilient natural systems can \\nwithstand changing conditions and readily recover from extreme floods, \\nstorms, and droughts. They also provide cost-effective and self-\\nsustaining protections and benefits, including reducing flood risks, \\nsustaining fish and wildlife, improving water quality, regulating \\nsediment loading, stabilizing soil, sequestering carbon, and providing \\nrecreational opportunities.\\n    Natural infrastructure and nature-based solutions should be a \\nmainstream choice for our infrastructure investments. We know, based on \\nyears of evidence, that this approach saves lives and taxpayer dollars. \\nConserving, restoring, and investing in natural and nature-based \\nfeatures makes communities safer and more resilient by absorbing \\nfloodwaters, buffering storm surges, and giving rivers room to spread \\nout without harming homes and businesses. Studies show that restoration \\ncan create from around 10 to 40 jobs per $1 million invested. Natural \\ninfrastructure reduces the need for new, often expensive structural \\nprojects, and provides an important extra line of defense when levees \\nor other structures are required. Natural infrastructure also avoids \\nunintended adverse impacts such as diverting floodwaters onto other \\ncommunities and inducing development in high risk areas.\\n    For too long, Congress and conservation-focused organizations \\nlooked past people when focusing on wildlife, public lands, clean \\nwaterways, forests and headwaters, coastal dunes and wetlands, mountain \\npeaks and pristine coasts. This approach has left behind communities of \\ncolor and treated environmental justice and frontline communities as \\nafterthoughts. We should center the health and safety of people when we \\nprioritize the conservation and restoration of natural systems, while \\nalso advancing our goals to recover wildlife, provide clean water and \\nair, reduce erosion, and promote outdoor recreation -- all while \\nsequestering large amounts of the excess carbon dioxide currently in \\nthe atmosphere.\\n    On behalf of the National Wildlife Federation, our 52 state and \\nterritorial affiliates, and our nearly 7 million members and \\nsupporters, we are grateful for the leadership of this Committee in \\nlaying out thoughtful policy recommendations for natural climate \\nsolutions, including conserving and restoring forests, grasslands, \\nfloodplains, and ocean and wetland ecosystems; boosting federal \\nspending for new and existing conservation programs to help farmers and \\nranchers adopt practices that help wildlife and stabilize the climate; \\nhelping wildlife adapt to climate change by establishing wildlife \\ncorridors and implementing landscape-scale conservation plans; and \\nensuring equitable access and benefits from natural climate solutions.\\nA Highly Cost-Effective Solution\\n    For every $1 that we spend on pre-disaster mitigation, we will save \\n$6 to $8 in avoided damages and taxpayer costs. Because of our archaic \\nbudget rules, it's easier to spend hundreds of billions of dollars \\nafter a disaster through a supplemental appropriation than it is to \\ninvest in the ounce of prevention that could have mitigated the damage \\nin the first place. While we score the immediate cost of $1 of \\nmitigation, we fail to account for the long-term cost avoidance on \\ndisaster relief and recovery. This just doesn't make sense. As a \\nresult, we've spent nearly $300 billion in disaster supplementals over \\nthe past decade and that number will only grow. And we urge the \\ncommittee to consider working with the Senate to amend both rules and \\nstatutes like PAY-GO to account for the net-savings that such \\ninvestments will achieve, while not undercounting the increased \\nexpenditures that will accrue without action.\\n    There is a wide and growing body of literature demonstrating how \\ninvesting in nature before and after natural disasters reduces costs to \\ntaxpayers, landowners, and insurers while also saving lives and \\nprotecting property.<endnote-reference>[1]</endnote-reference> For \\ninstance, coastal ecosystems represent a critical buffer against \\nhurricanes and other storms. One acre of wetlands can typically store \\n1-1.5 million gallons of floodwater.<endnote-reference>[2]</endnote-\\nreference> According to a 2008 study, coastal wetlands in the United \\nStates provide an estimated $23.2 billion per year in storm protection \\nservices, or as much as $5 million per square kilometer of \\nwetland.<endnote-reference>[3]</endnote-reference>\\n    Living shorelines, such as marshes enhanced with oyster reef \\nbreakwaters, hold up better than bulkheads during major storm \\nevents.<endnote-reference>[4]</endnote-reference> This protection also \\ncomes at lower cost than traditional protective infrastructure. For \\nexample, reviving reefs and mangroves can be an order of magnitude more \\ncost-effective than installing seawalls or breakwaters.<endnote-\\nreference>[5]</endnote-reference> Moreover, residents with bulkheads in \\ncoastal North Carolina report paying double the cost to repair their \\nproperty and four times the cost for annual shoreline maintenance when \\ncompared to residents with more natural shorelines.<endnote-\\nreference>[6]</endnote-reference> Living shorelines also protect \\nagainst coastal erosion on a day-to-day basis, while maintaining \\nconnectivity of shoreline habitat.<endnote-reference>[7]</endnote-\\nreference>\\n    In coastal Louisiana, investments in wetland restoration generated \\n28 times as much flood protection, dollar-for-dollar, than a similar \\ninvestment in six-meter high dikes.<endnote-reference>[8]</endnote-\\nreference> In Florida, it has been estimated that comprehensive \\nrestoration of the Everglades would yield a four-to-one return on \\ninvestment.<endnote-reference>[9]</endnote-reference> And, wetlands can \\nalso help industry meet regulatory requirements at lower cost than by \\nconstructing costly water treatment facilities.<endnote-\\nreference>[10]</endnote-reference>\\n    Beach restoration and dune nourishment can provide protection from \\nmajor storm events, boost the local economy through increased \\nrecreation, and provide habitat for migratory birds. When Superstorm \\nSandy hit the East Coast in 2012, Cape May Point, New Jersey, had \\nrecently completed a project to widen two miles of the beach, build an \\n18-foot tall dune, and restore nearby freshwater wetlands. Cape May \\nPoint suffered virtually no damage, while surrounding areas sustained \\n$640 million in losses. A host of birds have flocked to the restored \\nwetlands and beach, and ecotourism from birders is estimated to add \\nmore than $310 million per year to the county's revenue.<endnote-\\nreference>[11]</endnote-reference>\\n    Floodplain acquisition projects have been effective in reducing \\nflood risk, bringing down flood insurance premiums, and creating green \\nspaces for recreation. Along Mingo Creek in Tulsa, Oklahoma, local \\nproperty owners and businesses have not suffered property losses due to \\nflooding since a voluntary buyout program was implemented in 1984. \\nAdditionally, residents have received up to a 35% discount on their \\nflood insurance premiums, which reflects their reduced flood \\nrisk.<endnote-reference>[12]</endnote-reference>\\n    Inland, reforestation, climate-smart forest management, and \\nwatershed restoration all have the potential to bolster natural carbon \\nsequestration, benefit wildlife, and provide economic benefits \\nincluding job creation. In Oregon, each dollar of public investment in \\nforest and watershed restoration is multiplied in economic activity \\nbetween 1.7 and 2.6 times as it cycles through Oregon's \\neconomy.<endnote-reference>[13]</endnote-reference> Similarly, it was \\nestimated that the first year of the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation \\nEconomic Development Pilot Program, alone, would cost less than $30 \\nmillion but generate more than $140 million in revenue while creating \\n3,000 jobs and attracting more than 600,000 visitors to the region in \\nKentucky.<endnote-reference>[14]</endnote-reference>\\n    The need to address greater risks from wildfires in many grasslands \\nand forested areas has also grown considerably in recent years due to \\nclimate-related increases in extreme heat and drought, combined with \\nhigher fuel loads due to nearly a century of over-reliance on fire \\nsuppression. Indeed, the cost of wildfire impacts has grown \\nconsiderably as more people have moved in to the so-called ``wildland \\nurban interface.''<endnote-reference> [15]</endnote-reference> A 2015 \\nstudy estimated that at least 1.1 million homes are at the highest risk \\nfrom wildfire in the western United States, with a reconstruction cost \\nof $268 billion dollars.<endnote-reference>[16]</endnote-reference> In \\nturn, land management agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service have had \\nto spend significantly larger portions of their budgets on fire \\nsuppression, eroding their ability to fund restoration and management \\nactivities to improve ecosystem health and resilience.<endnote-\\nreference>[17]</endnote-reference>\\n    Ecological forest management has emerged as an important concept \\nfor addressing wildfire risks as well as enhancing the health of forest \\nsystems. Specifically, ecological forest management may include a \\ncombination of strategic thinning, prescribed fire, and managed \\nwildfire to reduce the risk of high-severity wildfire and promote \\nhealthier, more-resilient forests. Done thoughtfully, the approach can \\nhelp balance tradeoffs between short-term costs and impacts of \\ntreatment with long-term benefits of reduced risks of large, high-\\nseverity fires. For example, a combination of thinning and prescribed \\nfire in eastern and southern California was found to have significantly \\nreduced burn severity in trees during 12 wildfires that occurred \\nbetween 2005 and 2011.<endnote-reference>[18]</endnote-reference>\\n    Further, improved community planning and collaborative risk \\nmanagement efforts, including both targeted codes and ordinances and \\nvoluntary, incentive-based approaches, have significantly reduced risks \\nfrom wildfires. For example, the Firewise USA \\x04 recognition program, a \\ncollaborative effort between state and federal agencies and \\nnongovernmental organizations, has been working with communities across \\nthe country to reduce wildfire risks by encouraging homeowners to \\nimprove defensible space in their neighborhoods. Recent fires have \\ndemonstrated the program's success. For example, two consecutive fires \\nin the community of Indian Lakes Estates, Florida, spared numerous \\nhomes and structures due to risk reduction preparations that homeowners \\nmade under the program.<endnote-reference>[19]</endnote-reference> Such \\nprograms are likely to be increasingly important as insurance companies \\ncontinue to assess the risks from worsening wildfires and adjust rates \\nand coverage accordingly.<endnote-reference>[20]</endnote-reference>\\n    By updating our scoring rules to account for the net savings we can \\nboth increase investment in these life-saving projects, while reducing \\nthe long-term national debt projections.\\nIncreasingly Severe Weather Events Are Wreaking Havoc on Communities\\n    Natural climate solutions are essential to our ability to adapt to \\nunavoidable climate impacts, build resilience, and meet net-zero goals. \\nAdaptation is an essential partner to climate mitigation, and nature-\\nbased solutions can play a major role for both and provide significant \\nco-benefits for water, air, recreation, hazard reduction, and many \\nother services to society. However, natural climate solutions must \\nvalue biodiversity and be ecologically appropriate to ensure no harmful \\nunintended consequences.\\n    The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a \\nreport in February that warned climate change is already severely \\nimpacting people and the ecosystems we depend on in every region of the \\nworld, with the poorest and most vulnerable at greatest risk, and one \\nmillion animal and plant species facing the threat of extinction -- \\nmore than any other time in human history. The IPCC also reported that \\ndespite an increase in adaptation activities by governments, \\nbusinesses, and civil society, far more is needed to help people and \\nwildlife prepare for a changing world.\\n    America is facing increasingly severe storms and floods, extreme \\ndroughts, massive wildfires and record high temperatures, fueled by a \\nrapidly changing climate.<endnote-reference>[21]</endnote-reference> We \\nhave suffered more billion-dollar inland flood disasters in the last \\ndecade than in the prior three decades combined. We have endured more \\nbillion-dollar hurricane disasters in the last five years than in the \\ndecade before.<endnote-reference>[22]</endnote-reference> The human \\nsuffering caused by these and many smaller disasters is incalculable, \\nwith low-income and frontline communities bearing a disproportionate \\nshare of the harm.\\n    The ever-mounting toll of human suffering and economic loss from \\nnatural disasters shows no sign of abating and every sign that it will \\ncontinue to grow. Research shows that both the intensity and number of \\nextreme storms will continue to increase appreciably as our climate \\nwarms. In some locations, future extreme events could be twice as \\nintense as historical averages.<endnote-reference>[23]</endnote-\\nreference> By 2100, previously rare extreme rainstorms could happen \\nevery two years.<endnote-reference>[24]</endnote-reference> By 2050, \\nhigh tides could cause ``sunny day'' flooding in coastal communities 25 \\nto 75 days a year.<endnote-reference>[25]</endnote-reference> By the \\nend of the century, homes and commercial properties currently worth \\nmore than $1 trillion could be at risk of chronic flood \\ninundation.<endnote-reference>[26]</endnote-reference>\\n    Storms and floods in the United States disproportionately harm \\nBlack, Latinx, Indigenous, low-income, and frontline communities. For \\nexample, the neighborhood that suffered the worst flood damage during \\nHurricane Harvey was in an area of southwest Houston where 49 percent \\nof the residents are people of color. Similarly, damage from Hurricane \\nKatrina was most extensive in the region's Black neighborhoods. In \\nfact, in four of the seven ZIP codes that suffered the costliest flood \\ndamages from Hurricane Katrina, at least 75 percent of residents were \\nBlack.<endnote-reference>[27]</endnote-reference> Over the next 30 \\nyears, the ``risk of coastal floods damaging or destroying low-income \\nhomes will triple'' resulting in the flooding of more than 25,000 \\naffordable housing units each year.<endnote-reference>[28]</endnote-\\nreference>\\n    In addition, ``while severe storms fall on the rich and poor alike, \\nthe capacity to respond to and recover from flooding is much lower in \\nsocially vulnerable populations that even in the best of times are \\nstruggling to function.''<endnote-reference>[29]</endnote-reference> \\nEven low levels of flooding can wreak havoc on buildings and the \\nresidents who live in them, damaging belongings, disrupting electrical \\nequipment, contaminating water sources and septic systems, and \\ngenerating mold.

Known by a variety of terms--including \\nnatural infrastructure, natural defenses, natural climate solutions, \\necosystem-based adaptation, and natural and nature-based features--\\nnature-based solutions can effectively deliver both climate mitigation \\nand climate adaptation outcomes. In 2016, the International Union for \\nthe Conservation of Nature (IUCN) published a global standard for the \\nuse of these approaches, defining nature-based solutions (NbS) as \\n``actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and \\nmodified ecosystems in ways that address societal challenges \\neffectively and adaptively, to provide both human well-being and \\nbiodiversity benefits.''\\n    The use of natural and nature-based systems to address climate \\nrisks can encompass a wide range of options, from the protection and \\nconservation of still-intact natural systems, to the restoration of \\ndegraded ecosystems, to the use of engineered systems designed to \\nemulate natural system functions. Importantly, nature-based approaches \\ncan also be used in concert with structural options to form hybrid or \\n``green-gray'' systems for risk reduction. In practice, these \\napproaches can be as simple as planting trees in urban neighborhoods to \\nprovide shade and stormwater management benefits or as complex as \\nreengineering riverine systems to restore natural floodplains and \\nlessen flood risks and restore natural ecosystem functioning and \\nbiodiversity integrity.\\n    The National Wildlife Federation recently conducted a review and \\nsynthesis of nature-based solutions as a contribution to the U.S. \\nClimate Resilience Toolkit's Steps to Resilience planning framework. \\nThis review highlighted the following seven key considerations for \\nincorporating nature-based approaches into community-based climate \\nadaptation planning:\\n    <bullet>  Recognize natural systems and processes as critical \\ninfrastructure\\n    <bullet>  Consider climate impacts on priority natural assets\\n    <bullet>  Consider equity implications in the design and \\napplication of nature-based solutions\\n    <bullet>  Ensure that nature-based solutions yield net positive \\nbiodiversity benefits\\n    <bullet>  Seek to protect or restore critical natural \\ninfrastructure\\n    <bullet>  Give natural features and processes space to function\\n    <bullet>  Integrate nature-based solutions into existing planning \\nprocesses\\n    The Changing Climate and Massive Habitat Losses Have Pushed \\nWildlife to the Brink\\n    The changing climate, combined with historic and ongoing \\ndestruction, fragmentation, and degradation of vast swaths of habitat, \\nhave pushed America's wildlife into crisis, helping to drive the \\nplanet's ongoing sixth mass extinction of species.<endnote-\\nreference>[31]</endnote-reference> As many as one-third of America's \\nplant and wildlife species are vulnerable, with one in five imperiled \\nand at high risk of extinction.<endnote-reference>[32]</endnote-\\nreference>\\n    America's freshwater species have been particularly hard hit. \\nApproximately 40 percent of the nation's freshwater fish species are \\nnow rare or imperiled.<endnote-reference>[33]</endnote-reference> \\nNearly 60 percent of the nation's globally significant freshwater \\nmussel species are imperiled or vulnerable, and an additional 10 \\npercent are already extinct.<endnote-reference>[34]</endnote-reference>\\n    Our wildlife crisis extends well beyond rare and endangered \\nspecies, and now affects many widespread and previously abundant \\ncreatures, such as the little brown bat, monarch butterfly, and many of \\nour most beloved songbirds. State fish and wildlife agencies have \\nidentified more than 12,000 species nationwide in need of conservation \\naction, and fully one-third of North America's bird species require \\nurgent conservation attention.<endnote-reference>[35]</endnote-\\nreference> The best way to spur collaborative, proactive recovery \\nefforts to save these thousands of species of greatest conservation \\nneed is for Congress to pass the bipartisan Recovering America's \\nWildlife Act (H.R.2773).\\n    The historic loss and degradation of aquatic wildlife habitat \\nacross the country makes each additional acre of wetland lost or \\nnatural stream segment channelized even more consequential for the \\nlong-term viability of our nation's fish and wildlife. At least ten \\nstates have lost more than 70 percent of their wetlands, which provide \\nessential fish and wildlife habitat, while 22 states have lost 50 \\npercent or more of their original wetland acreage.<endnote-\\nreference>[36]</endnote-reference> The construction of levees to reduce \\nthe frequency and duration of flooding in the lower Mississippi River \\nValley is the single largest contributor to wetland losses in the \\ncountry, according to the Department of the Interior.[<endnote-\\nreference>[37]</endnote-reference> Fish and wildlife have also been \\nseverely harmed through the pervasive alteration of natural stream \\nflows, including from reservoirs and locks and dams, which have \\noccurred in 86 percent of the almost 3,000 streams assessed by the U.S. \\nGeological Survey.<endnote-reference>[38]</endnote-reference> It is \\npast time that we turn to the most ingenious engineer on the planet, \\nMother Nature, to help protect people and wildlife alike with natural \\ninfrastructure.\\nEcosystem Restoration Provides Multiple Environmental, Health, and \\n        Economic Benefits\\n    From the Coastal Louisiana to the Everglades and the Great Lakes to \\nthe Puget Sound, many iconic ecosystems across the country have \\nassociated restoration plans that, with enough support, could enhance \\nthe many co-benefits ecosystem restoration provides for communities and \\nwildlife alike. These watershed-wide ecosystem restoration programs and \\nplans were carefully crafted based upon the best available science and \\nwith extensive public input. They enjoy broad, bipartisan support, and \\ntheir success hinges on the construction and maintenance of shovel-\\nworthy infrastructure projects, including natural infrastructure \\nprojects. Implementing these plans creates thousands of good-paying \\njobs through the on-the-ground work needed to restore our nationally \\nsignificant lakes, rivers, and estuaries. Many federal and state \\nagencies -- including the Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental \\nProtection Agency, Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture, \\nand National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- have a critical \\nrole to play in supporting a robust restoration economy by developing \\nand implementing these watershed-wide restoration plans and programs.\\n    There are also critical watersheds -- such as the Ohio River, the \\nMississippi River, the Delaware River, and coastal Louisiana -- where \\nrestoration plans exist or are currently under development at the state \\nor regional level. These working watersheds are also home to many low-\\nincome and vulnerable communities, who suffer firsthand as a result \\nfrom the degradation and pollution of these rivers and surrounding \\nfloodplains.\\n    The recently passed bipartisan infrastructure law recognizes the \\nmultitude of benefits of investing in watershed-wide approaches that \\nutilize natural infrastructure to restore and protect our aquatic \\necosystems across the country. For example, it invested more than $1.7 \\nbillion in the Environmental Protection Agency's ecosystem restoration \\nprograms, including $1 billion to clean up toxic pollution, restore \\nfish and wildlife habitat, reduce farm and city runoff pollution, and \\nconfront invasive species through the federal Great Lakes Restoration \\nInitiative and $238 million for the Chesapeake Bay Program, which \\ncoordinates Chesapeake Bay watershed restoration and protection \\nefforts. The law also provided nearly $1 billion for coastal \\nrestoration and resilience investments through NOAA and through the \\nNational Coastal Resilience Fund, as well as $1.9 billion for Army \\nCorps of Engineers' aquatic ecosystem restoration efforts across the \\ncountry, including a historic $1 billion for efforts to restore the \\nEverglades. It contains a historic amount of funding for water \\ninfrastructure, including over $11.7 billion for the Clean Water State \\nRevolving Fund (CWSRF), of which at least 10 percent of each state's \\ncapitalization grants will go toward Green Project Reserve eligible \\nprojects, including natural infrastructure projects like wetland \\nrestoration and reforestation efforts.\\n    These investments, coupled with annual federal appropriations, will \\nhelp achieve comprehensive, watershed-wide restoration, enhancing \\ndrinking water quality, safeguarding nearby communities from floods and \\nsea level rise, sustaining local and regional economies, protecting \\nwildlife habitat, and creating jobs.\\n    Restored watersheds improve our quality of life, increase property \\nvalues, provide clean water, support fish and wildlife and enhance \\noutdoor recreation for our families. The on-the-ground work to restore \\nour coasts, lakes, rivers, and estuaries produces jobs and utilizes \\nskills and machinery available in the local workforce, benefiting local \\neconomies. These cost-saving, job-creating, and resilience-building \\ninvestments will also help advance the administration's goals to \\nconserve and restore 30 percent of America's lands and waters.\\n    Continuing to direct federal resources toward these widely-\\nsupported and thoughtfully-crafted regional restoration programs are \\namong the smartest and most strategic investments we can make as a \\nnation to create jobs, support regional economies, protect natural \\nresources, enhance fish and wildlife habitat, and make our roads, \\nbridges, water systems, and communities more resilient. These \\necologically and culturally-important natural places are nationally-\\nsignificant hubs of tourism, and many support and protect other \\ncritical industries including fisheries, shipping, and energy \\nproduction. Restoration implementation also supports a $25 billion \\n``restoration economy'' that directly employs 126,000 people and \\nsupports 95,000 other jobs, mostly in small businesses. Restoring these \\ngreat watersheds helps sustain our nation's $887 billion outdoor \\nrecreation economy. Through federal and state restoration we have an \\nopportunity to stimulate growth and produce jobs in regional economies, \\nand to support the national outdoor economy for years to come. Some \\nspecific examples of the benefits of investing in ecosystem \\nrestoration, and opportunities to expand ecosystem restoration efforts, \\ninclude:\\n    <bullet>  Coastal Louisiana and the Mississippi River Delta: Large-\\nscale restoration of coastal Louisiana presents a significant \\nopportunity to protect existing infrastructure and industries of \\nnational importance, while growing a restoration economy that can be a \\nmodel for other coastal communities around the world. Resources should \\nbe directed to implement critical large-scale restoration projects in \\ncoastal Louisiana, drawn from the state's Coastal Master Plan. These \\ninvestments would protect vulnerable communities, sustain critical \\nwildlife habitat, and create jobs. Additionally, lifting the existing \\ncap on shared Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) revenues \\nwould increase resources available to sustain a restoration economy.\\n    <bullet>  Mississippi River Restoration and Resilience Initiative: \\nCongress should pass H.R. 4202, the Mississippi River Restoration and \\nResilience Initiative (MRRRI) Act, to establish a non-regulatory EPA \\ngeographic program for the Mississippi River mainstem states. The MRRRI \\nAct centers natural infrastructure solutions that have co-benefits for \\nflood risk reduction, water quality improvements, wildlife habitat, \\nrecreation, and other services to communities. It would enhance federal \\ncoordination with the Army Corps and other agencies around a shared \\nagenda to improve the overall health and resilience of the Mississippi \\nRiver, through collaboration with states, Tribes, local governments, \\nand other river stakeholders.\\n    <bullet>  Chesapeake Bay Restoration: The Chesapeake Bay watershed \\nis home to more than 18 million people and spans 64,000 square miles \\nacross parts of Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, \\nand West Virginia and the entire District of Columbia. Over the past \\ndecade, the states and the federal government have jointly committed to \\na massive restoration program in the Bay watershed to restore the Bay \\nand its tributaries by 2025. The COVID-19 pandemic has set back \\nprogress -- from delayed implementation of conservation practices on \\nfarms to the implementation of stormwater practices in urban areas. \\nNone of the watershed's restoration goals can be met without the \\nleadership, guidance and accelerated funding support provided by \\nvarious federal agencies, especially the Environmental Protection \\nAgency.\\n    <bullet>  Delaware River Basin Restoration Program: More than 13 \\nmillion people rely on clean drinking water from the Delaware River \\nwatershed, including residents of New York City, Philadelphia, Trenton, \\nCamden, and Wilmington. The Delaware River Basin Restoration Program, \\nadministered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, develops a \\ncoordinated approach to identify and implement restoration and \\nconservation activities across the Delaware River watershed, including \\nnatural infrastructure projects that help restore water quality, \\nenhance water management efforts, improve wildlife habitat, and create \\npublic access through the entire Delaware River watershed.\\n    <bullet>  Everglades: The bipartisan plan to restore America's \\nEverglades involves constructing a suite of resilience-building water \\ninfrastructure projects designed to remove barriers to water flow and \\nto clean, store, and send water south. Completing the restoration \\nmilestones outlined in the Army Corps' Integrated Delivery Schedule for \\nEverglades restoration will create over 65,000 jobs, protect drinking \\nwater supplies of more than 9 million Floridians, and enhance wildlife \\nhabitat. It will also make Florida more resilient in the face of \\nclimate change by defending against saltwater intrusion, strengthening \\nshorelines, protecting coastal and inland communities from flooding, \\nand sequestering carbon through restoring seagrass, mangrove, and \\nwetland habitat. Congress should appropriate $725 million to the Army \\nCorps of Engineers in FY 23 to maintain critical recent momentum to \\naccomplish keystone projects within the Comprehensive Everglades \\nRestoration Plan.\\n    <bullet>  Great Lakes Restoration Initiative: Investing in the \\nGreat Lakes Restoration Initiative, which helps protect, restore, and \\nmaintain the Great Lakes ecosystem, will protect the drinking water for \\nover 30 million Americans, create jobs, and safeguard public health. \\nAdvancing the implementation of such projects in this region creates a \\n3-to-1 return on investment in local communities, from new real estate \\nand commercial development, to boosting outdoor recreation and tourism, \\nand more housing options and higher home values.\\n    <bullet>  National Estuary Programs: The EPA's National Estuary \\nPrograms help protect and restore water quality and habitat in 28 \\nestuaries of national significance in the United States. These \\nestuaries provide important ecosystem services, create wildlife \\nhabitat, support economically significant fisheries, and generate \\nbillions of dollars in tourism revenues for the country. This program \\nleverages $22 on average in local, state and private sector investment \\nfor every $1 of federal funds appropriated to the program.\\n    <bullet>  Ohio River Basin: The Ohio River supplies drinking water \\nto more than 5 million people, and millions more depend on the river \\nfor their health, jobs, and quality of life. Unfortunately, the Ohio \\nRiver basin faces the worst water pollution in the nation that \\nthreatens drinking water quality, wildlife habitat, and human health. \\nResources should be invested in developing and implementing a plan to \\nrestore and protect the Ohio River basin ecosystem.\\n    <bullet>  Texas Coastal Resiliency Master Plan: Resources should \\nsupport ecosystem restoration projects described in the Texas Coastal \\nResiliency Master Plan, an inclusive stakeholder and community-driven \\nplan that identifies nature-based solutions spanning the entire nearly \\n400 miles of coastline to help the state shore up its coast and \\nwithstand accelerating erosion rates, sea level rise, and increasingly \\nintense Gulf storms.\\n    However, ecosystem restoration and the deployment of natural \\ninfrastructure doesn't have to be at the watershed scale to make a \\nmeaningful impact. Local and regional restoration efforts around the \\nnation are creating important benefits for people and wildlife. For \\nexample, long-term partnerships between the National Wildlife \\nFederation and local communities have led to innovative resilience \\nprojects around the country, including in the Great Marsh of \\nMassachusetts, and along the Eastern Shore of Maryland, in the town of \\nOxford, where a project will incorporate living breakwaters into a \\ndesign that works with nature to protect coastal communities threatened \\nby increased sunny day flooding and coastal storms.\\n    Additionally, as part of the Resilient Schools Consortium (RiSC) \\nprogram for middle and high schools in New York City, public school \\nstudents aged 12 to 20 are planting and caring for native trees on \\ntheir school grounds to help mitigate urban heat island and absorb \\nstormwater. They're planting thousands of American beach grass plants \\nto stabilize dunes in the frontline community of Coney Island, \\nBrooklyn. Once mature, these vegetated dunes will help to mitigate \\nflooding and property damage from coastal storms, and help to prevent \\nthe migration of sand into shoreline roads. These education efforts are \\nfoundational to addressing the multi-generational threat of climate \\nchange and the need for adaptation.\\nAn Ounce of Prevention is Worth a Pound of Cure\\n    The value of natural systems for protecting communities has long \\nbeen recognized. In a 1972 study evaluating options to reduce flooding \\nalong the Charles River in Massachusetts, the Army Corps of Engineers \\nconcluded:\\n    ``Nature has already provided the least-cost solution to future \\nflooding in the form of extensive [riverine] wetlands which moderate \\nextreme highs and lows in streamflow. Rather than attempt to improve on \\nthis natural protection mechanism, it is both prudent and economical to \\nleave the hydrologic regime established over millennia \\nundisturbed.''<endnote-reference>[39]</endnote-reference>\\n    Wetlands prevented an estimated $625 million in flood damages in \\nthe 12 coastal states affected by Hurricane Sandy, and reduced damages \\nby 20 to 30 percent in the four states with the greatest wetland \\ncoverage.<endnote-reference>[40]</endnote-reference> Coastal wetlands \\nreduced storm surge in some New Orleans neighborhoods by two to three \\nfeet during Hurricane Katrina, and levees with wetland buffers had a \\nmuch greater chance of surviving Katrina's fury than levees without \\nwetland buffers.<endnote-reference>[41]</endnote-reference> The forest \\nand other conservation lands that make up the 28,000 acre Meramec \\nGreenway along the Meramec River in southern Missouri contribute about \\n$6,000 per acre in avoided flood damages annually. Wetlands in the \\nEagle Creek watershed of central Indiana reduce peak flows from \\nrainfall by up to 42 percent, flood area by 55 percent, and maximum \\nstream velocities by 15 percent.\\n    Evidence of the effectiveness of natural climate solutions in \\nreducing flood and storm damages continues to mount, as highlighted in \\nthe National Wildlife Federation's report, The Protective Value of \\nNature<endnote-reference>[42]</endnote-reference> and in the examples \\nprovided as an appendix to this testimony. As aptly noted by the \\nReinsurance Association of America: ``One cannot overstate the value of \\npreserving our natural systems for the protection of people and \\nproperty from catastrophic events.''<endnote-reference>[43]</endnote-\\nreference>\\n    Natural infrastructure is also often more cost-effective than \\nstructural measures. A recent study documents that using natural \\ninfrastructure solutions to reduce coastal flood risks in Texas, \\nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Florida would have a benefit-cost ratio of \\n3.5 compared to just 0.26 for levees and dikes. Restoring wetlands in \\nthis region could prevent $18.2 billion in losses while costing just $2 \\nbillion to carry out. Natural infrastructure also has the significant \\nadded benefits of being self-sustaining and avoiding the risk of \\ncatastrophic structural failures. Importantly, natural infrastructure \\ncan work both alone and in combination with more traditional gray \\ninfrastructure to reduce flood and storm risks. And while gray \\ninfrastructure deteriorates over time, particularly when exposed to \\nclimatic conditions that exceed their design parameters, natural \\ninfrastructure often has significant adaptive capacity and an ability \\nfor self-repair.\\n    A new approach that prioritizes nature-based pre-disaster \\nmitigation and resilience will save taxpayers money and make our \\ncommunities safer. Far too often, we approach resilience planning \\nthrough the lens of disaster response and recovery rather than through \\nproactive efforts to increase the resilience of vulnerable communities \\nand water resources before disaster strikes.\\n    One clear example of this is evidenced by the Army Corps' history \\nof supplemental appropriations. From 2005 to 2016, the Corps received \\n$31.4 billion in supplemental funding, which amounts to almost half of \\nthe agency's annual discretionary appropriations over that same period. \\nOf those supplemental funds, 87 percent ($27.2 billion) was provided to \\nrespond to flooding and other disasters. With ever increasing effects \\nfrom storms, these emergency supplemental appropriations have also \\ndramatically increased over time, with the Corps receiving ``$1.1 \\nbillion in the 1990s, $19.2 billion in the 2000s, and $29.0 billion in \\nthe 2010s.'' Many of these expenditures could have been avoided, if we \\nhad invested in the necessary resilience projects. Even though we know \\nthat for every $1 invested in pre-disaster mitigation, we save $6 in \\navoided costs, Congressional budgetary rules continue to make it much \\neasier to fund an emergency supplemental appropriation after a disaster \\nthan to invest in the ounce of prevention that could have saved money \\nand reduced damage in the first place.\\nNature Can Help Mitigate Climate Change\\n    Natural ecosystems also have the ability to sequester and store \\nlarge amounts of atmospheric carbon, the primary driver of accelerating \\nclimate change. Indeed, natural climate solutions have the potential to \\nremove and store more than an additional gigaton of carbon dioxide \\nannually. Such nature-based solutions should be a central component of \\nthe nation's climate mitigation strategy.\\n    Forests and other wooded areas represent one of the best \\nopportunities to remove carbon from the atmosphere quickly, reliably, \\nand relatively cheaply. In 2017, the combination of forest land, \\nharvested wood products, and urban trees in the United States accounted \\nfor an estimated net uptake of 730.9 million metric tons of carbon \\ndioxide equivalent (MMT CO<INF>2</INF> eq.)<endnote-reference>[44]</\\nendnote-reference> -- the equivalent of 15 percent of our economy-wide \\nCO<INF>2</INF> emissions (Domke et al., 2020). Forested ecosystems also \\nprovide an abundance of ecosystem services and societal benefits: they \\ncreate habitat for wildlife, produce clean water, provide space for \\nrecreation, regulate temperatures, and much more. Between 1990 and \\n2017, ``forest land remaining forest land'' was the nation's largest \\nnet carbon sink, and conversions of forest land were the largest source \\nof land-based emissions.<endnote-reference>[45]</endnote-reference> \\nHowever, these benefits depend on careful policy and program design and \\nimplementation. The combined pressures on forests from development, \\nintroduced pests and diseases, aberrant patterns of precipitation, \\nfragmentation, and extreme fire can hamper forest growth and even \\nprevent successful regeneration after disturbance.\\n    It is important, however, to optimize rather than maximize carbon \\nin implementing natural solutions. Strategies that focus strictly on \\nmaximizing carbon sequestration -- such as converting natural habitat \\nto plantations of rapidly growing tree species -- may run counter to \\nimportant ecological and social values. Avoiding conversion of existing \\nforests, especially carbon-rich old growth, increasing reforestation of \\nhistorically forested areas, and focusing afforestation on severely \\ndegraded lands can all balance ecological and climate needs. Management \\nof the nation's forests should also take account of the changing \\nclimate, while also restoring natural patterns of fire and other \\necological processes. Urban forestry also deserves significantly more \\nattention for its multiple benefits to air quality, reduction in energy \\nuse and the urban heat island effect, absorbing stormwater, and \\nproviding wildlife habitat.\\n    Forest and watershed restoration not only increase the climate \\nbenefits of forests by increasing their ability to store carbon, but \\nalso reduce emissions from fire and decay. A rapidly changing climate, \\nincluding more severe drought and changing weather patterns, coupled \\nwith more than a century of fire exclusion and excessive fuels, has \\nincreased the size and intensity of wildfire.\\n    Mitigating the size, severity, and effects of forest fires, and \\nreconnecting forest systems, is essential to ensure watershed health \\nand function, and to optimize the climate benefits forests provide. We \\ncan and must better manage our forests, as ecologically appropriate, to \\nincrease the capacity for our forests to store carbon and produce clean \\nwater. The National Wildlife Federation is grateful that the proposed \\nreconciliation package included $27.5 billion for forest restoration, \\nand we urge the committee to help ensure it remains in any final \\nversion that is signed into law.\\n    At the same time, fire is an essential component of many of our \\nforest ecosystems. Prescribed burns can mimic natural processes and \\nreduce fuel loads, unlock nutrients, and reduce the intensity of future \\nwildfires. Furthermore, embracing traditional ecological knowledge and \\npractices and forming authentic partnerships with Indigenous peoples in \\nforest management can be another tool to help to restore the \\nfundamental role fire played in many forested ecosystems, while \\nsimultaneously supporting traditional cultural practices and \\nlivelihoods (Marks-Block et al., 2021).\\n    Good forest and watershed management is about more than just fire. \\nFor example, we need to restore forests at the landscape level and \\nconsider their management over longer lengths of time, but also be \\nnimble to account for uncertainty. The U.S. Forest Service estimates \\nthat 75-82 million acres of our nation's forests need restoration, \\nincluding nearly 2 million acres where changes in climate have thwarted \\nnature's ability to reseed and grow forests.\\n    With more than 50 percent of the nation's forestlands under private \\nownership, it's clear that partnering with landowners will be an \\nessential part of any strategy to increase the climate, wildlife, and \\ncommunity benefits these ecosystems provide. Tax credits for carbon \\ncapture accomplished through natural climate solutions could play a key \\nrole in halting deforestation, increasing restoration and thereby \\naccelerating greenhouse gas reductions, while providing a host of \\nvaluable co-benefits, including increased soil productivity and \\nresilience, water quality and quantity, wildlife habitat and landowner \\neconomics. Such a provision could promote additional carbon storage in \\nthe soils and vegetation of our nation's private grasslands, wetlands, \\nforests and agricultural lands. Modeling such a tax credit on the 45Q \\nprovision for direct air capture could provide parity among natural and \\ntechnological carbon storage in terms of incentives. In addition, there \\nis a need for incentives to promote responsible, long-term stewardship \\nof forestlands and ensure that the public goods they provide will be \\nenjoyed for years to come. Programs such as those of the Healthy \\nForests Reserve Program and the collaborative Regional Conservation \\nPartnership Program, which has been used to restore critical longleaf \\npine (Pinus palustris) habitat in the Southeastern United States are \\ncritically underfunded.\\n    Since the time of European colonization, we have lost millions of \\nacres of biodiverse bottomland hardwood forests, primarily to \\nconversion for agricultural uses -- and when these forests are lost, so \\nare the invaluable services they provide to adjacent communities, \\nincluding flood water retention and water quality protection (Allen et \\nal., 2004). Investing in restoration of these ecosystems can reduce \\nburdens on gray infrastructure while simultaneously providing habitat \\nwhere waterfowl and other wildlife can thrive, especially in regions \\nwith imperiled wetland forests, such as the coastal plains of the \\nSoutheast.\\n    We also have abundant opportunities to improve the productivity and \\nresilience of agricultural land through targeted forest restoration. In \\nformerly forested areas, restoring tree cover can block wind to reduce \\nerosion, create habitat for pollinators and other beneficial \\nbiodiversity, or even help to diversify farmer's income with timber \\nproducts (USDA, Agroforestry). We should not, however, encourage \\nafforestation and tree planting in native grasslands and other \\nhistorically non-forested ecosystems, as this can have dire negative \\nconsequences on biodiversity and carbon reservoirs (e.g., Tolgyesi et \\nal., 2022).\\n    As extreme climate events increase in frequency, some agricultural \\nlands may begin to flood so frequently that they transform from asset \\nto liability. Restoring riparian forest buffers (30 meters, or about \\n100 feet) and reforesting floodplains with bottomland hardwoods \\nrepresents another enormous opportunity to increase climate mitigation \\nwhile providing a suite of ecosystem benefits, including flood \\nattenuation, erosion prevention, and habitat conservation for aquatic \\nspecies (Cook-Patton et al., 2020).\\n    Open urban areas have been identified as another high priority area \\nfor reforestation and forest restoration (Cook-Patton et al., 2020). \\nAnd with around 80 percent of the nation's residents inhabiting cities, \\nincreasing access to nature and ecosystem service provisioning for \\nurban residents may be one of the most impactful actions at our \\nfingertips.\\n    Urban trees in the United States store an estimated 643 million \\nmetric tons of carbon, and sequester an estimated 25.6 million tons \\nannually.<endnote-reference>[46]</endnote-reference> Urban forests \\noffer an incredible array of other benefits: they moderate the urban \\nheat island effect, lowering energy bills and providing shade and \\nrelief from extreme heat; they intercept rainfall, reducing the \\nintensity of storm impacts on urban gray infrastructure; they can be \\nstrategically used to enhance air quality -- in other words, they can \\nhelp us to adapt to many of the challenges of climate change (Pataki et \\nal., 2021). Urban forest patches can provide spaces for recreation, \\nreflection, and wildlife observation not available elsewhere in the \\nurban landscape. Their presence can even provide benefits to physical \\nand mental health (Wolf et al., 2020). The Forest Service estimates \\nthese services are valued at more than $18 billion annually (Nowak et \\nal., 2018).\\n    Yet at the present, we know that urban forest canopy cover is often \\ninequitably distributed among racial groups and income levels (Gerrish \\nand Watkins, 2018; Watkins and Gerrish, 2018; Tree Equity, American \\nForests). This exacerbates disparities in exposure, for example, to the \\nurban heat island effect and in related health risks or financial \\nburdens related to cooling. Historical discriminatory policies such as \\nredlining have shaped these patterns of inequity, with formerly \\nredlined communities often containing less than half the tree canopy \\n(Locke et al., 2021) and experiencing elevated temperatures in compared \\nto their counterparts, by an average 2.6+C and up to 7+C (Hoffman et \\nal., 2020).\\n    We can and should take advantage of the benefits urban forests can \\nprovide. But interventions must be community-led. Attempts to ``green'' \\ncommunities or increase tree plantings without authentic community \\nengagement, consultation, and involvement at all stages can result in \\nunintended and harmful consequences, including displacement resulting \\nfrom changes in property values, maintenance costs shouldered by \\nresidents, and even negative effects on health (Wolch et al., 2015; \\nJelks et al., 2021). On the other hand, investment in workforce \\ndevelopment to support climate-informed urban forest restoration and \\nreforestation presents yet another opportunity to stimulate local \\neconomies and create jobs.\\nRestoring America's Grasslands for Resilience and Carbon Sequestration\\n    As important as our nation's forests are, its grasslands and \\nsagebrush steppe ecosystems cannot be forgotten. They are as critical \\nto climate success, wildlife habitat, and clean water, as they are \\niconic. They are working lands, relied upon by ranchers, farmers, \\nenergy developers, hikers, campers and hunters. They are also home to \\nhundreds of species of wildlife, from mule deer to snowshoe hare to \\nmeadowlark. Yet, investments in their restoration and management are \\nneeded to ensure their role as an important tool in combating climate \\nchange.\\n    A 2018 University of California at Davis study surmised that \\ngrasslands could be a greater and more reliable carbon sink than \\nforests, because they are less ``climate-vulnerable.'' Forests store \\nmost of their carbon in the soil, but less than grasslands, so when \\nforests, which are more susceptible to climate conditions, burn they \\nrelease more carbon into the atmosphere relative to grasslands. Jim \\nBlackburn, professor at Rice University and co-director of its Severe \\nStorm Prediction, Education and Evacuation from Disasters Center \\nestimates that grasslands could potentially capture 1 billion metric \\ntons of carbon each year -- more than 14 percent of U.S. annual \\nemissions.\\n    Unfortunately, grasslands are the fastest declining ecosystem in \\nthe United States, disappearing at rates exceeding those of the Amazon \\nrainforest.<endnote-reference>[47]</endnote-reference> As a result, \\ngrassland birds have suffered the steepest losses of all bird species, \\nwith populations declining 53 percent since 1970.<endnote-\\nreference>[48]</endnote-reference> At least 60 percent of historical \\ngrasslands have been converted to cropland and other land uses, with \\nsome areas having lost upward of 90 percent over the last two centuries \\n(Brennan and Kuvlesky 2005). The loss and degradation of these habitats \\nhave had, and will continue to have, dire consequences for biodiversity \\nand provisioning of ecosystem services, including their ability to \\nstore carbon and contribute to climate change resilience.\\n    These losses are also especially troubling for the thousands of \\nspecies of pollinators who rely on grasslands as habitat. One out of \\nevery three bites of food we eat is supported by pollinators, including \\nwild bees and other species -- adding more than $15 billion to the \\nnation's crop values.\\n    Grasslands and sagebrush steppe are threatened by invasive grasses \\nthat outcompete native grasses and carry fire, and development and \\ncropland conversation. Invasive cheatgrass covers as much as 100 \\nmillion acres of land in the United States, a serious problem for \\nwildlife and an accelerant for catastrophic fire on both public and \\nprivate land. On private land, we lose a football field's worth of \\ngrasslands every four seconds to development and cropland conversion. \\nWe've lost 40 percent of grassland birds in our lifetimes, and some \\nindicator species, like the Greater Sage-grouse, are teetering on the \\nedge of listing under the Endangered Species Act. We must invest in \\nrestoration on our public lands, and find new tools for collaboration \\nto conserve and restore private land.\\n    The highly successful North American Wetlands Conservation Act \\n(NAWCA) provides a model for this type of collaborative work on private \\nlands. It was signed into law in the 1980s when waterfowl numbers were \\nin sharp decline. Because of collaborative action sparked by the act, \\nwaterfowl have since increased by 56 percent. Not only do we need to \\ninvest in protecting and restoring our federal grasslands, we need to \\nauthorize a program for private lands modeled after NAWCA, the North \\nAmerican Grasslands Conservation Act.\\n    To slow continued losses of grasslands to crop production, Congress \\nshould make national, the Farm Bill's Sodsaver provision -- a common-\\nsense crop insurance reform currently effective in six states \\n(Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Montana) \\nthat reduces crop insurance rates on newly converted agricultural acres \\nfor the first three years of production. This reform corrects a policy \\nincentive to convert marginal land to crop production.\\n    Significant investments in grasslands and sagebrush steppe \\nrestoration and passage of the North American Grasslands Conservation \\nAct would increase these ecosystems' ability to store and retain \\ncarbon, reduce grassland and rangeland wildfire, increase water \\nresources, and improve technology to control cheatgrass and other \\ninvasive species.\\nMaking Agricultural Lands More Profitable and Resilient\\n    U.S. farmers and ranchers are uniquely productive compared to the \\nrest of the world. Popular and oversubscribed USDA conservation \\nprograms can further enhance and make producers, and their agro-\\necosystems, more resilient to extreme weather events exacerbated by \\nclimate change. Programs like the Conservation Stewardship Program, \\nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, Conservation Reserve Program, \\nand Regional Conservation Partnerships Program, among others, are \\nexamples of public-private partnerships that are in high demand from \\nproducers and conservationists but lack the funding to meet that \\ndemand. In the past decade nearly 1 million applicants have been \\nrejected by the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, alone (Happ, \\nMichael. 2021. ``Closed out: How U.S. Farmers Are Denied Access to \\nConservation Programs.'' Institute for Agriculture & Trade Policy. \\nhttps://www.iatp.org/documents/closed-out-how-us-farmers-are-denied-\\naccess-conservation-programs (March 28, 2022)).\\n    Agricultural conservation has many co-benefits for farmers, \\ncommunities, and the climate (Henneron, L., et al. 2015. ``Fourteen \\nYears of Evidence for Positive Effects of Conservation Agriculture and \\nOrganic Farming on Soil Life.'' Agronomy for Sustainable Development \\n35: 169-81.). Cover crops enhance soil health by reducing erosion and \\nproviding natural weed suppression, reducing unintended consequences of \\noverusing increasingly expensive pesticides and herbicides. Diverse \\ncrop rotations can also improve a farm's mitigation and adaptation to \\nclimate change by naturally cycling nutrients, reducing pests and \\ndisease, and while providing a diversified income stream to producers. \\nReduced or no-till farming rapidly sequesters carbon in the soil and \\nreduces agricultural runoff and erosion of precious topsoil. Further, \\nproducers with livestock and cropping systems can increase soil carbon \\nwhile reducing costs on feed and fertilizer (Khalil, Mohammad Ibrahim \\net al. 2019. ``Strategic Management of Grazing Grassland Systems to \\nMaintain and Increase Organic Carbon in Soils.'' CO2 Sequestration. \\nhttps://www.intechopen.com/online-first/strategic-management-of-\\ngrazing-grassland-systems-to-maintain-and-increase-organic-carbon-in-\\nsoils (June 10, 2020). Fully implementing these practices could remove \\nas much as 100- 200 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually by \\n2050.<endnote-reference>[49]</endnote-reference>\\n    Technical assistance, research, and extension provided by USDA \\nconservation programs are essential for increased adoption of cover \\ncrops, diversified crop rotations, decreased tillage, and livestock \\ngrazing integration with row crops, among others. The United States' \\ntopsoil is disappearing at twice the rate as it was during the Dust \\nBowl (DeLonge, Marcia, and Karen Perry Stillerman. 2020. Eroding the \\nFuture: How Soil Loss Threatens Farming and Our Food Supply. Union of \\nConcerned Scientists. https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep28410 (August \\n9, 2021)). Unfortunately, USDA conservation programs are greatly \\noversubscribed and unable to meet the demand from producers and need \\nfor conservation practices on the land that can address climate and \\nensure healthy soil, water and wildlife resources into the future. A \\ndoubling of conservation funding would begin to address this demand and \\nneed.\\nReclamation of Degraded Lands\\n    Investments in reclamation of degraded lands such as abandoned mine \\nlands, orphaned oil and gas wells, brownfield sites, and Superfund \\nsites are also an integral part of the climate solution. With proper \\nmanagement, these lands can be turned into forests, grasslands, prairie \\nlands and soils that have the potential to sequester millions of tons \\nof carbon dioxide annually while mitigating other harmful emissions \\nlike methane, protecting biodiversity, improving air and water quality, \\nand revitalizing local economies through job creation and increased \\nproperty value and tax revenues.\\nBlue Carbon\\n    Oceans and coastal ecosystems also play a valuable role in \\nmitigating climate change, particularly through the ability of \\nwetlands, mangroves, and seagrasses to capture and store carbon, as \\nwell as buffer the effects of sea-level rise and increasingly severe \\nstorms. These repositories of ``blue carbon'' sequester more carbon per \\nunit area than forests, and store carbon for a longer period of \\ntime.<endnote-reference>[50]</endnote-reference> Therefore, maintenance \\nand enhancement of these ecosystems are a critical part of a successful \\nclimate strategy -- for mitigation, climate adaptation, and community \\nresilience objectives.\\nKey Bipartisan Opportunities for Congress\\nLEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR NATURAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS\\n    <bullet>  Replicating the Success of 45Q for Natural Climate \\nSolutions: The broadly supported and bipartisan 45Q federal tax credit \\nfor carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration currently provides a \\nmuch-needed financial incentive for reducing carbon dioxide emissions \\nfrom industrial sources, power plants, and through direct air capture \\ntechnologies. An opportunity exists to replicate this successful model \\nto also spur innovation and deployment of capital into natural climate \\nsolutions that sequester additional carbon through restoration of our \\ngrasslands, forests, wetlands, waters, and agricultural lands.\\n    Creating a 45X tax credit for natural climate solutions would \\ncatalyze private investment onto private, public, and Tribal lands, \\nwhile providing greater policy parity for natural solutions with their \\ntechnological counterparts. It would be a game changer. In addition to \\naccelerating GHG sequestration, such investments would improve the \\neconomics of investing in natural carbon sinks, while also increasing \\nsoil productivity, boosting resilience (reducing erosion, etc.), \\nimproving water quality/quantity, and providing wildlife habitat.\\n    A 45X tax credit provision could be modeled upon 45Q, providing a \\nper ton credit for additional carbon storage in natural systems at a \\ncost point that's a fraction of the 45Q incentive levels ($20-$30/ton \\non average natural solutions compared to \\x0b$50-$130/ton for CCUS). While \\nthe IRS would implement the tax credit, as it does for 45Q, USDA could \\nmanage the measurement/practices side for private lands (this could \\nbuild upon the carbon accounting protocols envisions by the Growing \\nClimate Solutions Act), DOI could manage protocols for investments in \\npublic lands (in conjunction with USDA for National Forests), and NOAA \\ncould manage protocols for blue carbon. Tax credits could either be \\nrefundable (as proposed by the enhanced 45Q) or transferable for when \\nthe value of the tax credit is greater than the taxpayer's tax \\nliability. We believe such an approach would enjoy bipartisan support \\nacross the political spectrum.\\nKey principals for program integrity:\\n    <bullet>  Predictability/simplicity: The credit must be easily \\nunderstandable and accessible for all communities, especially \\nIndigenous communities, people of color, small landowners, veterans, \\netc. to ensure equitable distribution of the benefits of the program;\\n    <bullet>  Additionality: Investments must produce new reductions \\nabove and beyond the baseline and do not ``double pay'' for tons \\nalready accounted for through carbon offset programs/purchases;\\n    <bullet>  Permanence: Investments must sequester carbon over the \\nlong-term; and,\\n    <bullet>  Ecologically appropriate: Restoration/reforestation \\ninvestments must be ecologically consistent for the project's location \\n(e.g. native plants) and should provide co-benefits of resilience, \\nhabitat, clean water, etc., as documented through a credible, but \\nsimple, management plan.\\n    A 45X tax credit could include multiple options for participation:\\n    <bullet>  Practice-based option for small landowners: Tax credit \\nwould be determined by approved practices on the land implements \\n(selected from an approved USDA list of practices with well-documented \\nand predictable results that meet standards of additionality, \\npermanence, and ecologically-appropriateness). This approach would \\nallow smaller landowners to participate and could be easily implemented \\nby USDA.\\n    <bullet>  Performance-based option for large landowners: Tax credit \\nis determined by carbon sequestration performance above a baseline as \\ndocumented by a carbon registry, approved by USDA. This approach would \\nwork better for larger landowners, offers opportunities at scale, and \\nencourages innovation.\\n    <bullet>  Natural sequestration on public lands and waters: Tax \\ncredit opportunities should also exist for private investment on public \\nlands (BLM, USFS) and waters (NOAA, etc.) to sequester carbon in \\necologically-appropriate ways and provide addition public co-benefits. \\nThis would drive significant investment into states with significant \\npublic lands, while expanding opportunities for job creation and \\nrevenues.\\n    Encourage Conservation of Lands with High Carbon Sequestration, \\nResilience, and Habitat Values: Just as the Congress came together to \\ncreate Opportunity Zones to encourage private investment in \\neconomically distressed communities, similar opportunities exist to \\nimprove the economic incentives for conserving lands that have high \\ncarbon sequestration, resilience, or wildlife habitat values. Such an \\napproach would recognize the higher public value of these lands and \\ncompensate landowners accordingly with a higher incentive level than \\nthe one-size-fits all traditional approach that does not consider \\necological value.\\n    Pass the Growing Climate Solutions Act: The bipartisan Growing \\nClimate Solutions Act would direct USDA to standardize protocols for \\nmeasuring carbon sequestration on agricultural lands. This would create \\nnew revenue opportunities for America's farmers through voluntary \\nactions and participation in private and public carbon markets.\\nENSURE RESILIENCE INVESTMENTS ACCOUNT FOR NET-SAVINS IN CBO SCORING\\n    <bullet>  Modernize CBO scoring rules: Through the House Rules \\npackage and other vehicles, ensure that investments in resilience that \\nwould achieve clear and demonstrable net-savings score as debt-\\nreducing. This would free up resources for proactive investments, end \\nthe cycle of ever-growing disaster supplemental appropriations, and \\nreduce long-term debt.\\nPASS BIPARTISAN CONSERVATION INVESTMENTS\\n    <bullet>  Bipartisan Recovering America's Wildlife Act: This \\nlandmark piece of bipartisan legislation will restore essential \\nwildlife habitat in all 50 states and territories to recover the more \\nthan 12,000 species of greatest conservation need through proactive, \\ncollaborative and voluntary actions. This will restore natural systems \\nacross the country that will also provide critical resilience services \\nfor communities and additional carbon sequestration capacity.\\n    <bullet>  North American Grasslands Conservation Act. Grasslands \\nare the fastest declining ecosystem in the United States, but they are \\nalso underappreciated powerhouses of carbon sequestration and storage. \\nAuthorizing a program modeled after NAWCA should be a top priority.\\n    <bullet>  Wildlife corridors: Helping wildlife adjust to changing \\nand shifting habitat conditions by facilitating wildlife movements is a \\ncritical climate adaptation strategy. Congress took a major step \\nforward by passing a comprehensive wildlife crossings program, \\nincluding the first funding committed to wildlife crossings, as part of \\nthe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Wildlife corridors must \\nalso be maintained away from roads and highways. We appreciate that the \\nHouse of Representatives passed the full Wildlife Corridors \\nConservation Act as part of the INVEST in America Act and encourage \\ncontinued work on wildlife corridors legislation and the Tribal \\nWildlife Corridors Act.\\n    <bullet>  Trillion Trees: The idea of accelerating the pace of \\nforest restoration is a critical climate solution. We're encouraged by \\nthe bipartisan, bicameral negotiations that could result in a consensus \\nbill to achieve essential ecologically-appropriate reforestation, \\nresilience, and carbon sequestration goals.\\nWATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT\\n    There are key opportunities that Congress can pursue to enhance the \\nability of natural ecosystems to provide climate mitigation, \\nresilience, and other benefits to communities in the context of the \\nWater Resources Development Act of 2022, which is currently under \\ndevelopment. More specifically, in the 2022 bill Congress should:\\n    <bullet>  Increase Organizational Capacity Through a Resilience \\nDirectorate. Congress should establish a Resilience Directorate within \\nthe Office of the Chief of Engineers at the Corps of Engineers to \\nimprove the Corps' ability to reduce flood risks, promote coordinated \\nplanning across districts and Corps business lines and among Federal \\nagencies, and better leverage the benefits of natural infrastructure. \\nThe Directorate should be tasked with ensuring that existing programs, \\nauthorities, and operations take full advantage of natural \\ninfrastructure and adopt modern, comprehensive planning approaches. \\nCritically, the Directorate should have the resources and budgetary \\nauthority needed to work and coordinate across Corps business lines to \\ninfuse resilience into every aspect of the Corps' work. Congress should \\nalso establish ``community and natural systems resilience'' as a co-\\nequal project purpose for each water resources project to eliminate a \\nperceived barrier to comprehensive resilience planning. These reforms \\nwill help the Army Corps -- one of our nation's most influential \\nresilience agencies -- take full advantage of its programs and \\nauthorities to improve community and water resources resilience and \\navoid piecemeal planning that can increase flood risks and recovery \\ncosts.\\n    <bullet>  Utilize Federal and State Expertise. Congress should \\nensure that the Corps utilizes the expertise of federal and state fish \\nand wildlife experts when planning projects. Congress should direct the \\nCorps to utilize recommendations made pursuant to mandatory Fish and \\nWildlife Coordination Act reviews that derive from the special \\nexpertise of federal and state fish and wildlife experts (e.g., methods \\nand metrics for assessing fish and wildlife impacts and mitigation \\nopportunities). The Corps often ignores these critically important \\nrecommendations, leading to projects that cause unnecessary harm and to \\nmitigation plans that do not work. Utilizing these carefully developed \\nstate and federal expert recommendations is a common sense, cost-\\neffective way to make projects better and improve planning efficiency.\\n    <bullet>  Employ Voluntary Easements to Improve Resilience. \\nCongress should ensure the Corps has the tools it needs to develop and \\nimplement resilient solutions. Congress should: (a) direct the Corps to \\nmap all flood easements, conservation easements, and permanently \\nprotected lands and waters in the project area when assessing the \\nimpacts and benefits of a water resources project; (b) direct the Corps \\nto map the many flood easements already purchased by the Corps across \\nthe country to facilitate consideration of those easements when \\nplanning projects and updating operating plans; and (c) direct \\nconsideration of Corps purchased permanent flood easements as an \\nappropriate natural infrastructure solution. Increasing reliance on \\nvoluntary flood and other conservation easements will facilitate \\ndevelopment of resilient solutions.\\nFARM BILL\\n    <bullet>  Bolster Working Lands Conservation Programs. Congress \\nshould double the funding levels for these popular and successful \\nprograms to ensure they can continue to provide benefits to producers, \\nwildlife, and adjacent communities. The historic funding increases \\nproposed in the House-passed reconciliation bill would accomplish this \\ngoal.\\n    <bullet>  Develop Workforce and Capacity to Meet Reforestation and \\nRestoration Goals. With additional stocking of our nation's lands, \\nforest ecosystems could uptake nearly 20 percent more CO<INF>2</INF> \\nthan they already do (Domke et al., 2020). Whether on public and \\nprivate forestlands, successful reforestation and active forest \\nrestoration depends upon the capacity of nurseries to collect seeds and \\nproduce healthy growing stock, as well as the availability of a \\nworkforce for nursery production, site preparation, planting, and \\nmaintenance (Fargione et al., 2021). And with a rapidly changing \\nclimate, we need to ensure that nurseries cultivate and supply robust \\nseedlings, suited for local site conditions and -- as much as possible \\n-- the conditions of the future. According to a survey of nurseries, \\nlabor shortages create the largest bottleneck in the ``reforestation \\npipeline'' (Fargione et al., 2021). Investing in a 21st-century \\nCivilian Conservation Corps that puts millions of young Americans to \\nwork, in a manner that benefits all communities and provides high-\\nquality workforce development to prepare participants for jobs in the \\nprivate sector, remains one of our best options to address this \\nbottleneck. Investments in infrastructure, innovation, and research in \\nthis space are also badly needed. Expanding both public and private \\nnursery capacity via Farm Bill programs and other targeted funding will \\nprovide jobs and stimulate rural economies.\\nOther Key Opportunities:\\n    <bullet>  Increase Green Project Reserve Funding Through the Clean \\nWater State Revolving Fund (CWSRF): Since its inception in 1987, the \\nCWSRF has provided over $153 billion in low-cost financing to water \\nquality projects across the nation. In 2009, Congress passed the \\nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which required that states \\nallocate at least 20 percent of their annual CWSRF capitalization grant \\nfor green infrastructure, water efficiency, energy efficiency, and \\nother environmentally innovative projects. It successfully helped shift \\nfederal and state wastewater investment toward projects that utilize \\ngreen and natural infrastructure and promote holistic approaches to \\nwastewater treatment systems. The Green Project Reserve requirement has \\nbeen extended via appropriations bills every year, but was reduced in \\nFiscal Year 2012 to 10 percent annually. In order to create additional \\ncertainty and incentive for projects that utilize green and natural \\ninfrastructure, Congress should permanently require states to use at \\nleast 20 percent of their annual CWSRF capitalization grants for the \\nGreen Project Reserve. This will help communities finance green \\ninfrastructure projects that address climate change, enhance access to \\ngreen space, protect wildlife habitat, and improve water quality.\\n    <bullet>  Ensure Hazard Mitigation Programs Support Natural \\nSolutions: Hazard mitigation programs at FEMA, HUD, and through the \\nNational Flood Insurance Program are significant potential sources of \\nresources for nature-based hazard risk reduction. Although natural \\ninfrastructure projects are eligible for many of these programs, \\nchallenges exist that impede successful applications for nature-based \\nprojects, including in the context of Benefit Cost Analyses and \\nfeasibility demonstration requirements. FEMA should continue work to \\nensure that the Benefit Cost Analysis toolkit is supportive of \\ndifferent nature-based project types, and allows communities to capture \\nthe full array of their benefits. The agency should also work to \\nprovide communities with additional detailed guidance on designing and \\nsuccessfully applying for funding for nature-based projects. These \\nimprovements should be accompanied by additional technical assistance \\nand capacity building support to ensure that all communities benefit \\nfrom this solution set to improve health and safety. Congress should \\nsupport expanded consideration of natural solutions for hazard \\nmitigation by requiring at least 15% of funding through the Building \\nResilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program to be \\ndesignated for nature-based projects, and/or by authorizing and \\ndirecting FEMA to partner with the National Fish and Wildlife \\nFoundation (NFWF) to establish a demonstration grant program designed \\nto fund nature-based projects through FEMA hazard mitigation dollars. \\nBy encouraging FEMA to partner with NFWF, Congress can bring NFWF's \\nunique expertise to efforts to promote nature-based mitigation \\nprojects, build capacity at all levels of government, and help to \\nfurther demonstrate the efficacy and multiple benefits delivered by \\nthese types of projects. Additionally, NFWF has flexibility to build \\npublic private partnerships to support natural infrastructure projects \\nand to leverage private sector funding to support added investment. \\nFinally, Congress can support natural solutions by fully reauthorizing \\nand reforming the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to ensure \\nNFIP premiums communicate accurate levels of risk, with means-tested \\nassistance for those who cannot afford actuarial rates; expanding pre-\\ndisaster mitigation efforts, including through nature-based solutions; \\nand increasing funding available for updated and climate-informed \\nfloodplain maps.\\n    <bullet>  Increase Funding Available for Gulf Coast Restoration and \\nResilience: Congress should increase offshore energy revenues shared \\nwith Louisiana and other states under the Gulf of Mexico Energy \\nSecurity Act (GOMESA), including by lifting the current cap on revenues \\nshared. The State of Louisiana, through a constitutional amendment, has \\ncommitted these revenues to restoration and resilience efforts, \\nincluding implementation of the state's Coastal Master Plan. With no \\ntime to lose in the battle against sea level rise and coastal land \\nloss, additional GOMESA revenues are vital to continue the essential \\nand urgent work that this funding stream has enabled.\\n    <bullet>  Mississippi River Restoration and Resilience Initiative: \\nCongress should pass H.R. 4202, the Mississippi River Restoration and \\nResilience (MRRRI) Act, to establish a non-regulatory EPA geographic \\nprogram for the Mississippi River mainstem states, following the \\nsuccessful model in the Great Lakes. The MRRRI Act centers natural \\ninfrastructure solutions that have co-benefits for flood risk \\nreduction, water quality improvements, wildlife habitat, recreation, \\nand other services to communities. It would enhance federal \\ncoordination around a shared agenda to improve the overall health and \\nresilience of the Mississippi River, through collaboration with States, \\nTribes, local governments, and other river stakeholders.\\n    <bullet>  Enhance the Capacity of Federal Agencies to Access Needed \\nClimate Adaptation Science: Over the past decade federal agencies have \\nmade important advances in developing their capacity to provide support \\nand climate science to natural resource managers and others charged \\nwith the conservation and restoration of the nation's lands, waters, \\nand wildlife. Congress should provide robust budget support to such \\nprograms as the U.S. Geological Survey Climate Adaptation Science \\nCenter Network, the NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments \\n(RISA) Program, and the USDA Climate Hubs. In order to assure the \\navailability of such climate science for natural resource managers, \\nCongress should pass H.R. 6654, the ``Climate Adaptation Science \\nCenters Act,'' which would permanently authorize the U.S. Geological \\nSurvey's National and Regional Climate Adaptation Science Centers.\\n    <bullet>  Support Ocean-Based Climate Solutions: Congress should \\nadvance solutions that leverage and support the immense climate \\nmitigation and adaptation potential of ocean and coastal ecosystems, \\nwhich can make coastal communities more resilient and can provide for \\nthe conservation and restoration of ocean and coastal habitats, \\nbiodiversity, and marine mammal and fish populations. This includes \\nefforts to advance the protection and restoration of blue carbon \\necosystems including wetlands, mangroves, kelp, and seagrass, to \\naddress challenges with ocean acidification impacts, and to protect and \\nrestore coral reef ecosystems that buffer communities.\\n    <bullet>  Appropriations and other Spending Packages: As Congress \\nconsiders how to fund priorities in Fiscal Year 2023 and beyond, the \\nNational Wildlife Federation strongly urges you to ensure that \\nAmerica's lands, waters, and wildlife are not left out of any future \\ninvestment package. With hurricane and wildfire seasons fast \\napproaching, communities around the country are bracing for another \\nrecord-breaking year of extreme weather and natural disasters that \\ndevastate local economies, ecosystems, and families. Congress has an \\nopportunity to prevent lost lives and livelihoods with proactive, \\nrobust investment in natural infrastructure and natural climate \\nsolutions.\\n    During the COVID pandemic, Americans sought refuge outdoors -- from \\nneighborhood parks to hiking trails to the most remote wilderness spots \\nin our nation. Families and friends were able to connect safely \\noutside, and millions rediscovered or newly adopted lifelong hobbies \\nlike hunting, fishing, and bird watching. However, this increased use \\n-- coupled with decades of neglect and underfunding -- has strained our \\nforests, wetlands, grasslands, and rivers, as well as the wildlife \\ninhabiting them. It is critical that Congress invest in the restoration \\nand resilience of these shared spaces so that future generations may be \\nable to enjoy them.\\n    Our outdoor heritage is part of the fabric of our society, and it \\nsupports an $887 billion outdoor recreation economy. In addition to the \\neconomic and societal benefits, these natural landscapes provide a \\nsignificant opportunity to address the climate crisis, both in \\nadaptation and mitigation. Healthy forests sequester carbon and filter \\nregional water supplies. Resilient shorelines protect communities from \\nstorm and flood damage. Removal of invasive species like cheatgrass \\nhelps prevent catastrophic fires. Restoration and resilience projects \\ncan be tailored to every community in America, improving safety and \\nputting people to work. That's why we're encouraged that the bipartisan \\nIIJA included more than $50 billion for resilience and restoration \\nprojects and that the proposed reconciliation package recommends \\ninvesting an additional $100 billion in on-the-ground work like forest \\nrestoration and conservation programs at USDA; public lands, national \\nparks, wildlife habitat, and species recovery through the Department of \\nthe Interior; funding for Tribal nations; and coastal resilience \\ninitiatives at the Department of Commerce. These resources can flow to \\ncommunities quickly and make an immediate impact, so long as there is \\nsufficient consultation and permitting staff to efficiently process the \\nproject proposals.\\nConclusion\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify at this important \\nhearing. Natural infrastructure has the potential to mitigate the \\nthreats facing millions of Americans while also conserving and \\nrestoring the landscapes and waterways essential to our wildlife \\nheritage and way of life.\\n    The good news is that bipartisan investments in natural \\ninfrastructure have already started under your leadership. The \\nbipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act made historic \\ninvestment in natural landscapes essential to our water, wildlife, and \\nway of life -- as well as natural infrastructure. The law includes $492 \\nmillion for the National Coastal Resiliency Fund, a program established \\nin 2018 that invests in restoration and resilience projects that expand \\nnatural infrastructure like wetlands and barrier islands. The bill also \\nincluded $350 million to support the development and construction of \\nwildlife crossings that will improve habitat connectivity and reduce \\nwildlife-vehicle collisions. These investments, from our coasts to our \\nhighway system, will save lives.\\n    These investments show Congress has already started to transition \\ntoward natural solutions. On behalf of the National Wildlife \\nFederation, our members, supporters, and affiliates, I would urge you \\nto continue down this path. Natural infrastructure is a proven strategy \\nto save lives, protect homes and businesses, conserve and restore our \\npublic lands and waters, and practice fiscal responsibility. Thank you \\nand I look forward to your questions.\\nEndnotes\\n    <endnote-reference>[1]</endnote-reference> Glick, P., E. Powell, S. \\nSchlesinger, J. Ritter, B.A. Stein, A. Fuller. 2020.

And good job on getting--summarizing your 30-\\npage----\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Voluminous.\\n    Ms. Castor [continuing]. Testimony in 5 minutes. Thank you \\nvery much.\\n    Mr. Loris, you are now recognized to give a 5-minute \\npresentation of your testimony.\\n\\n                    STATEMENT OF NICK LORIS\\n\\n    Mr. Loris. Thank you. I think Collin said double what I can \\nsay in the same amount of time, but I echo a lot of his \\nsentiments. So I appreciate that.\\n    Chair Castor, Ranking Member Graves, and distinguished \\nmembers of the Select Committee, thanks for this opportunity to \\ntestify this morning. My name is Nick Loris, and I am the Vice \\nPresident of Public Policy at the Conservative Coalition for \\nClimate Solutions.\\n    C3 Solutions is a think tank that focuses on policy reforms \\nto empower entrepreneurs and innovators to solve our greatest \\nenergy and environmental challenges. And with my time, I would \\nlike to make two brief observations.\\n    The first is to underscore the economic, environmental, and \\nclimate benefits of investing in America's natural ecosystems. \\nActive management of America's forests, grasslands, and \\nwetlands will improve air and water quality, restore wildlife \\nhabitat, and capture and sequester more carbon dioxide. Forest \\nrestoration and eradicating invasive species will also reduce \\nthe risk of wildfires, floods, and droughts.\\n    Furthermore, innovative agricultural technologies and \\npractices enable farmers and ranchers to produce more with \\nless. The result is higher yields, cost savings, and healthier \\nsoils that prevent erosion and sequester more CO<INF>2</INF>. \\nWithout active care and investment, however, the mismanagement \\nof America's ecosystems can increase greenhouse gas emissions \\nand pollution, exacerbate the risks of extreme weather, and be \\nan economic drain on communities.\\n    For instance, the 2020 wildfires in California emitted more \\ncarbon dioxide than the entire State's fossil fuel emissions \\nthat year. Addressing the fuel load through controlled burns \\nand timber harvesting will reduce the size and intensity of \\nwildfires and improve the health of America's forests.\\n    Another major challenge is invasive species, which devalue \\nproperties, damage infrastructure, devastate ecological \\nsystems, and threaten economic livelihoods. Whether it is \\ncheatgrass increasing wildfire risks, or zebra mussels \\ncompromising water infrastructure, invasive species impose \\nsignificant economic and environmental harm. Allocating \\nresources toward prevention, early detection, and rapid \\nresponse are the most cost-effective solutions, as they prevent \\nthe invasive species from becoming too invasive.\\n    Harnessing the power of incentives is also an effective \\nmechanism to reduce invasive species. For instance, the nutria \\nis a semiaquatic rodent that adversely affects wetlands and \\nvegetation in Louisiana and several other states. Through a \\nfederal-state program, participants can hunt and trap nutria \\nand receive $6 per nutria delivered to a collection center.\\n    Another example is a resource incentive where Florida's \\nFish and Wildlife Service provides a permit to harvest one \\nadditional spiny lobster for every 25 lionfish captured. The \\nState also held a contest to see who could capture the most \\nlionfish, and last year participants collected more than 3,400 \\nin total. These collaborative relationships that utilize \\nincentives are an effective tool to reduce and ideally \\neradicate invasive species.\\n    The second point I would like to underscore is the \\nimportance of reducing or removing barriers that obstruct or \\ndelay investments in healthy ecosystems. These projects \\nfrequently run into burdensome, time-consuming permitting \\nchallenges. In addition, conservation projects can be held up \\nfor years in litigation. The significant loss of time to \\nactively thin forests or eradicate invasive species often \\ncauses much worse environmental and climate outcomes. Rather \\nthan have pragmatic evaluation of risks and tradeoffs, \\nenvironmental reviews have too often devolved into a tool to \\nstunt the development of cleaner infrastructure and delay \\nprojects that will restore America's ecosystems.\\n    To be clear, environmental reviews are a critical part of \\nany project, as is the participation of the public and the \\ncommunities affected by that project. Modernizing permitting is \\nnot about removing environmental safeguards but increasing \\naccountability and improving efficiency.\\n    Permitting reforms will allow preventative and restorative \\necosystem investments to occur more resourcefully. Streamlined \\npermitting will stretch taxpayer dollars further and inject \\nmore private capital into natural climate solutions. Federal \\nagencies, States, the private sector, and nonprofits will be \\nable to tackle our backlog of environmental priorities with \\nmore urgency and efficiency.\\n    With respect to agriculture, pro-growth tax policies will \\nincentivize investment in new farming technologies and \\nequipment. And leveraging Department of Agriculture programs to \\nprovide technical assistance for farmers and ranchers who want \\nto pursue regenerative and precision agriculture will improve \\nsoil health and better optimize seed planting and treatment \\napplication, which will reduce the use of fertilizers, \\npesticides, fuel, and water.\\n    In conclusion, investment in healthy ecosystems is smart \\neconomic and climate policy. Rehabilitating forests, preventing \\nand eradicating invasive species, promoting sustainable \\nagriculture, and encouraging responsible land and water use \\npractices will result in better ecological health, will reduce \\nemissions, and will build up natural resiliencies to a changing \\nclimate.\\n    Natural climate solutions and healthy ecosystems will not \\ncome from treating America's lands and waters as if they should \\nbe stored behind glass in a museum. Instead they require active \\nattention, investment, and management. Policies and regulations \\nshould reflect those needs.\\n    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.\\n    [The statement of Mr. Loris follows:]\\n\\n                     America's Natural Solutions: \\n        The Climate Benefits of Investing in Healthy Ecosystems\\n\\n              House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis\\n\\n                 United States House of Representatives\\n\\n                             April 1, 2022\\n\\n                               Nick Loris\\n\\n                    Vice President of Public Policy\\n\\n      Conservative Coalition for Climate Solutions (C3 Solutions)\\n\\n    My name is Nick Loris, and I am the Vice President of Public Policy \\nat the Conservative Coalition for Climate Solutions (C3 Solutions). \\nThank you for this opportunity to appear before the select committee to \\ndiscuss the climate benefits of investing in healthy ecosystems.\\n    My written testimony consists of the following two sections:\\n\\n    <bullet>  The economic, environmental, and climate benefits of \\ninvesting healthy ecosystems. Natural solutions are integral to \\nreducing the risks of climate change. Conservation, restoration, and \\nbetter land practices create more opportunities for forests, \\ngrasslands, and wetlands to capture and store carbon dioxide. Active \\nland management that promotes healthy forests and eradicates invasive \\nspecies will also reduce the risk of wildfires, floods and droughts. \\nVarious farming and ranching practices such as regenerative agriculture \\nand precision agriculture will result in healthier soils and higher \\nyields while sequestering more emissions and reducing the risk of \\nflooding. In addition, integrating natural climate solutions for \\nremediating abandoned mine sites would minimize environmental \\nliabilities make these sites more economically attractive.\\n\\n    <bullet>  Expanding opportunities for investments for healthier \\necosystems. Policymakers should reduce barriers to healthy ecosystem \\ninvestment, improve incentives for productive federal-state and private \\npartnerships to prevent and eradicate invasive species. Furthermore, \\nCongress and the administration should provide pathways to expand the \\nuse of regenerative and precision agriculture and implement reforms \\nthat generate alternative funding sources for natural climate \\nsolutions.\\n\\nSection I. The economic, environmental, and climate benefits of \\n        investing healthy ecosystems\\n\\n    Investing in America's natural ecosystems will expand economic \\nopportunities and reduce environmental liabilities. Moreover, healthier \\necosystems will produce climate benefits by reducing greenhouse gas \\nemissions and reducing the risks of extreme weather events. Creating \\npositive incentive structures among private property owners, the \\nfederal government, tribes, and state and local governments will \\nimprove the environmental health of America's land and water systems. \\nWhether it is healthy forests or regenerative farms, empowering \\nlandowners to deploy local and specialized knowledge will best deliver \\neconomic, environmental, and climate benefits. Landowners have the most \\nto gain from responsible stewardship and the most to lose from \\nmismanagement. Natural climate solutions and healthy ecosystems will \\nnot come from treating America's forests, farmland, grasslands, and \\nwatersheds as if they should be stored in a museum. Instead, they \\nrequire active attention, investment, and management.\\n\\nActive forest management\\n\\n    Healthy forests are vital for America's environmental health and \\nare an essential natural climate solution. Forests in the United States \\nsequester about 16 percent of annual carbon dioxide emissions.\\\\1\\\\ \\nReducing deforestation and increasing tree cover will protect and \\nenhance a sound natural climate solution to sequester carbon dioxide. \\nFully restoring understocked, productive forestland in the U.S. could \\nincrease carbon sequestration by 20 percent.\\\\2\\\\ That is not to suggest \\na complete stop to logging, mining, building roads or other economic \\nreasons why private property owners may cut down trees. Rather, \\npolicymakers should eliminate illegal deforestation, establish defined \\nand legally protected property rights, and increase the availability of \\ncompensation for conservation.\\\\3\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Penn State Extension, ``How Forests Store Carbon,'' September \\n24, 2020,\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nhttps://extension.psu.edu/how-forests-store-\\ncarbon#:\\x0b:text=According%20to%20the%20US%20Forest,mainly%20in%20trees%20\\nand%20soil.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\2\\\\ Grant M.

While global \\ndecarbonization will help minimize human-induced warming's impact on \\nwildfires and wildfire seasons, a more immediate and effective solution \\nto reduce the size of wildfires is to address the fuel load. The fuel \\nload exacerbates the size and intensity of wildfires.

In effect, \\nlandowners would receive compensation for preventing and reducing \\ngreenhouse gas emissions or for sequestering carbon. This could include \\nactivities such as planting trees or farming and ranching practices \\nthat increase carbon sequestration. For companies that have set their \\nown net-zero targets, especially in hard-to-decarbonize sectors, \\noffsets provide a market-based mechanism to reduce or avoid emissions \\nat lower costs. For others, voluntary partnerships provide \\nopportunities for carbon removal. For instance, Shopify's \\nSustainability Fund has committed $32 million to carbon removal climate \\nentrepreneurs, many of which are delivering natural climate solutions \\n(for forests, soils, and mineralization).\\\\21\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\21\\\\ Shopify, ``Going All In To Get Carbon Out: Shopify's \\nCommitment to Climate Entrepreneurs Reaches $32M,'' March 28, 2022, \\nhttps://news.shopify.com/going-all-in-to-get-carbon-out-shopifys-\\ncommitment-to-climate-entrepreneurs-reaches-32m\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    These markets are not without their challenges. In some instances, \\noffset projects did not materialize in the ways expected. For example, \\nsatellite imagery has shown that forest preservation or reforestation \\nprojects covered only a fraction of the land they were intended to \\ncover.\\\\22\\\\ Another challenge is accurately measuring the emissions \\navoided or reduced. Soil samples taken to measure carbon stored can \\nvary depending on which methods samplers use. Renewable power output \\ncan change from day-to-day. A reforestation project could be wiped out \\nby a wildfire. The greatest challenge in verifying offsets is proving \\nadditionality. In other words, how can we be sure that farmers or \\nbusinesses aren't getting paid for something they were going to do \\nanyway? For example, if a company makes an investment in a new energy \\nsavings technology for financial reasons, but that technology also \\nreduces emissions, those emissions reductions are not additional. For \\nmany reasons, proving or disproving that counterfactual is difficult to \\ndo.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\22\\\\ Lisa Song, ``An Even More Inconvenient Truth: Why Carbon \\nCredits for Forest Preservation may be Worse Than Nothing,'' \\nProPublica, May 22, 2019, https://features.propublica.org/brazil-\\ncarbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-\\ndeforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    These markets, however, have made dramatic improvements in \\ncollecting accurate data, improving carbon accounting methodologies, \\nand having transparent, proper oversight. Third-party verifiers are \\nimproving methods to demonstrate the veracity of emissions reductions. \\nFor instance, one verifier tests soil at the beginning of an offset \\nproject, collects samples over the years and then inputs the data \\n``into an agricultural carbon model that estimates the sequestration \\nthat's taken place.'' \\\\23\\\\ Other companies, including Nori, are using \\nblockchain technology to create a voluntary, verifiable carbon removal \\nmarket for buyers and sellers.\\\\24\\\\ The Environmental Defense Fund, \\nWorld Wildlife Fund and Oeko-Institut (Germany) are setting up a carbon \\ncredit quality initiative.\\\\25\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\23\\\\ Jim Giles, ``Digging into the complex, confusing and \\ncontentious world of soil carbon offsets,'' GreenBiz, February 26, \\n2021, https://www.greenbiz.com/article/digging-complex-confusing-and-\\ncontentious-world-soil-carbon-offsets\\n    \\\\24\\\\ Nori, ``The Nori Carbon Removal Marketplace,'' https://\\nnori.com/\\n    \\\\25\\\\ Environmental Defense Fund, ``Carbon Credit Quality \\nInitiative: Assessing the quality of carbon credits,'' August 3, 2021, \\nhttps://www.edf.org/climate/carbon-credit-quality-initiative\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Like other methods to rehabilitate ecosystems that produce climate \\nbenefits, incentives matter.

Expanding opportunities for healthy ecosystem investment\\n\\n    There is no shortage of opportunities to invest in America's \\nnatural ecosystems and reap the economic, environmental and climate \\nbenefits that come with it. To capitalize on those opportunities, \\npolicymakers should reduce the regulatory barriers that obstruct or \\ndelay ecosystem investment. Congress and the administration should also \\nexplore ways to improve incentives for constructive partnerships and \\ngenerate alternative funding sources for natural climate solutions.\\n    Such reforms offer several noteworthy advantages. Permitting \\nreforms will allow preventative and restorative ecosystem investments \\nto occur more resourcefully. Efficient permitting and collaboration \\nwill stretch taxpayer dollars further, inject more private capital into \\nnatural ecosystem rehabilitation, and incentivize investments in \\nstewardship. The outcome will be a cleaner environment, more protection \\nfrom extreme weather and greater reductions in greenhouse gas \\nemissions. To that end, policymakers should:\\n\\n    <bullet>  Streamline forest and invasive restoration projects, \\nexpedite judicial review, and expand opportunities for timber \\ndevelopment. An April 2021 PERC report highlights the environmental and \\nclimate benefits of forest restoration. The report details many \\npragmatic recommendations to expedite forest restoration processes and \\nencourage collaborative partnerships.\\\\35\\\\ Notable policy solutions \\ninclude making categorical exclusions easier to apply for, excluding \\nprescribed burns from state emissions calculations, requiring lawsuits \\nto be filed quickly and resolved quickly, narrowing the scope of the \\nEndangered Species Act to on-the-ground impacts of endangered species, \\nopening timber markets for export, and allowing the Forest Service to \\nbe a ``Good Neighbor'' with states, tribes, and counties.\\\\36\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\35\\\\ Holly Fretwell and Jonathan Wood, ``Fix America's Forests: \\nReforms to Restore National Forests and Tackle the Wildfire Crisis,'' \\nThe Property and Environment Research Center, \\nApril 12, 2021, https://www.perc.org/2021/04/12/fix-americas-forests-\\nreforms-to-restore-national-forests-and-tackle-the-wildfire-crisis/\\n    \\\\36\\\\ Ibid.\\n\\n    <bullet>  Maximize funding and flexibility for wildfire prevention, \\nreforestation, and afforestation efforts.

The bills would provide funding and accelerate the \\nuse of fire detection equipment (including the use of satellites), \\nmatching grant programs for tree planting, seed and sapling funding, \\nand small tweaks to federal agency technical assistance for carbon \\nsequestration and forest management activities. Congress should also \\nexplore mechanisms to solve budgeting challenges of long-term forest \\nrestoration projects. As the PERC report underscores, ``Under the \\nAntideficiency Act and appropriations rules, the Forest Service cannot \\nobligate funds in advance of appropriations or after funding has \\nexpired. This constrains its ability to participate as an equal \\nfinancial partner when states, tribes, or private groups are willing to \\ncontribute funds to forest restoration.'' \\\\39\\\\ PERC recommends the \\ncreation of a restoration fund that would provide the funding certainty \\nand commitment toward long-term projects.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\37\\\\ S.4431--Emergency Wildfire and Public Safety Act of 2020, \\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/\\n4431#:\\x0b:text=This%20bill%20addresses%20wildfire%20preparedness, \\nwildfire%20due%20to%20climate%20change\\n    \\\\38\\\\ S.4985--Trillion Trees and Natural Carbon Storage Act, https:/\\n/www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4985/text\\n    \\\\39\\\\ Holly Fretwell and Jonathan Wood, ``Fix America's Forests: \\nReforms to Restore National Forests and Tackle the Wildfire Crisis,'' \\nThe Property and Environment Research Center, \\nApril 12, 2021, https://www.perc.org/2021/04/12/fix-americas-forests-\\nreforms-to-restore-national-forests-and-tackle-the-wildfire-crisis/\\n\\n    <bullet>  Reform the National Environmental Policy Act.

A common obstacle that can block or delay investments in \\nprojects that enhance ecosystems, reduce emissions, and provide natural \\nresilience for communities is the National Environmental Policy Act \\n(NEPA). President Nixon signed NEPA into law more than 50 years ago. \\nSince then, many federal, state, and local environmental laws have been \\nenacted, creating a confusing web of unclear, overlapping, and complex \\nrequirements. As columnist Ezra Klein recently wrote in the New York \\nTimes, NEPA is ``part of a broader set of checks on development that \\nhave done a lot of good over the years but are doing a lot of harm now. \\nWhen they were designed, these bills were radical reforms to an \\nintolerable status quo. Now they are, too often, powerful allies of an \\nintolerable status quo, rendering government plodding and ineffectual \\nand making it almost impossible to build green infrastructure at the \\nspeed we need.'' \\\\40\\\\ Green infrastructure also encompasses investments \\nin natural climate solutions. Rather than have pragmatic evaluations of \\nrisk and trade-offs, NEPA has too often devolved into a tool to stunt \\nthe development of cleaner infrastructure and to delay projects that \\nwill restore America's ecosystems.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\40\\\\ Ezra Klein, ``Government Is Flailing, in Part Because Liberals \\nHobbled It,'' The New York Times, March 13, 2022, https://\\nwww.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/opinion/berkeley-enrollment-climate-\\ncrisis.html\\n\\n       While the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act included and \\ncodified some important reforms, a more systemic overhaul is necessary. \\nTwo legislative proposals that would properly narrow the scope of NEPA \\nare the Undoing NEPA's Substantial Harm by Advancing Concepts that \\nKickstart the Liberation of the Economy Act (UNSHACKLE Act) \\\\41\\\\ and \\nthe Building United States Infrastructure through Limited Delays and \\nEfficient Reviews Act of 2021 (BUILDER Act).\\\\42\\\\ Environmental reviews \\nare a critical part of any project, as is the participation of the \\npublic and communities affected by the project.

Thank you very much.\\n    Next, Dr. Sherry Larkin, you are recognized for 5 minutes \\nto summarize your testimony.\\n    Welcome.\\n\\n               STATEMENT OF DR. SHERRY L. LARKIN\\n\\n    Dr. Larkin. Thank you.\\n    Good morning, Chair Castor, Ranking Member Graves, and \\nmembers of the Select Committee.\\n    Thank you for your willingness to hear of new solutions to \\naddress the impacts of climate change, solutions that improve \\nour coastal habitats, strengthen our communities' ability to \\nwithstand sea level rise, and increase America's blue economy \\nthat NOAA estimates affects 127 million people that live in \\ncoastal counties, municipalities, and parishes, or 40 percent \\nof the U.S. population.\\n    In 2018, America's blue economy supported 2.3 million jobs \\nand contributed $373 billion to the nation's gross national \\nproduct. In Florida, the share of the economy that is driven by \\nour coastline is well above 40 percent. It is over 75 percent, \\nmaking climate resilience intertwined with our state's future.\\n    My name is Sherry Larkin, and I am a professor in the Food \\nand Resource Economics Department at the University of Florida \\nand am the Director of the Florida Sea Grant College Program. \\nFlorida is one of 34 university-based programs in states that \\nborder the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Great Lakes, Gulf \\nof Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Guam.\\n    Science helps us understand how much our environment \\nreduces the economic impact of climate change. It is now time \\nfor us to partner fully with that environment to improve the \\nresilience of our coastal areas. In fact, in the recent \\nbipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Act, NOAA was awarded $1.5 \\nbillion for coastal resilience-related work. And FEMA was \\nawarded $3.5 billion for flood mitigation assistance. This is \\njust 1.3 percent of the annual contribution of our coastline to \\nour economy.\\n    Sea grant programs are charged with not just funding \\nscience relevant to local stakeholders but ensuring that those \\nfindings are communicated to the public and used by resource \\nmanagers in coastal communities. Every dollar of Federal \\ninvestment in sea grant must be matched with non-Federal funds \\nwhich is a model that fosters collaboration.\\n    The Blue Carbon Initiative indicates that 83 percent of \\nglobal carbon cycle is circulated through the ocean, and \\ncoastal habitats account for half of the carbon that is stored \\nsediments. That means there is an opportunity to invest in \\ncoastal habitats, which account for less than 2 percent of the \\ntotal ocean area. Just think of how big our blue economy can \\ngrow.\\n    In Florida, some of our activities in this space include \\nrestoring coastal sea grasses, mangroves, sponges, corals, and \\nsea oats habitats; improving coastal water quality by helping \\ndivert boats in which to clean marinas, and removing plastics \\nfrom oyster restoration projects; building the capacity of \\nlocal agencies, institutions, and associates to apply for \\nFederal funding; and improving FEMA's community ratings system \\nforce to reduce flood insurance premiums. We train shellfish \\naquaculture farmers and offer certifications for marine \\ncontractors to build living shorelines. We create public \\neducation programs like Climate Smart Floridians, Seagrass Safe \\nBoating, and Mangrove Trimming Best Management Practices that \\nhelp residents live more sustainably.\\n    Investigating regulatory revisions that would allow \\nshellfish growers to supply seafood and be used for coastal \\nrestoration is particularly needed in Florida. We are building \\nclimate alliances in the Gulf of Mexico region and to improve \\njustice, equity, diversity, and inclusion with respect to \\nhealth outcomes in the Southeastern U.S. and Caribbean.\\n    The reality is, to generate societal benefits, a lot of \\npieces need to be in place other than just habitat restoration, \\nnamely, number one, site-specific research that quantifies the \\nnet carbon benefits, estimates the feasibility and value of \\nalternative solutions, and evaluates proposed policies; number \\ntwo, education to encourage careers in natural coastal \\nsolutions and for homeowners, policymakers, and relevant \\nindustry sectors; and, number three, training and workforce \\ndevelopment to grow a new blue economy that benefits all \\nAmericans.\\n    As Sea Grant supports students and connects to the public \\nthrough boots-on-the-ground outreach, we believe we can create \\na grassroots movement, which is why I was delighted to learn \\nthat several graduate student leaders with the Campus Climate \\nCorps were planning to be in front of you today. And if we \\ndon't embrace the opportunity now, the blue economy could leave \\nAmerica behind and especially the underserved even perhaps \\nfurther behind.\\n    Finally, I wish to thank the network of Sea Grant programs \\nnationwide and all of our unrecognized government and NGO \\npartners, since we really do none of this alone. I appreciate \\nthe opportunity to share our collective vision regarding \\nnature-based solutions and look forward to our discussions.\\n    Thank you.\\n    [The statement of Dr. Larkin follows:]\\n\\n     Testimony for the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis\\n\\n                                   on\\n\\n                     America's Natural Solutions: \\n        The Climate Benefits of Investing in Healthy Ecosystems\\n\\n                        April 1, 2022 (updated)\\n\\n                        Sherry L. Larkin, Ph.D.\\n\\n            Professor, Food and Resource Economics, UF/IFAS\\n\\n              Director, Florida Sea Grant College Program\\n\\n    Chair Castor, Ranking Member Graves, and members of the Select \\nCommittee:\\n    Thank you for inviting me to testify today and your willingness to \\nlisten and learn of new solutions to address the impacts of climate \\nchange--solutions that improve our coastal habitats, strengthen our \\ncommunities' ability to withstand adverse environmental conditions, and \\nincrease America's Blue Economy. My name is Sherry Larkin, and I am a \\nprofessor in the Food and Resource Economics Department at the \\nUniversity of Florida and serve as the Director of the Florida Sea \\nGrant College Program. In my testimony I will describe several ongoing \\nprojects and conclude with an identification of the suite of tools and \\nskills that can help ensure natural solutions are effective at helping \\nmitigate the negative environmental and economic effects of climate \\nchange.\\n    I would like to begin by providing some context. As an economist \\nspecializing \\nin ways to measure the value of natural resources, I am thrilled to see \\nthe growing scientific literature that estimates the economic value of \\nour nation's natural capital--and a genuine interest from resource \\nmanagers and policy makers committed to ensure those values are \\nsustained, and perhaps even grow with targeted investments. Our nation \\nbenefits greatly from our natural environment--from our watersheds that \\nstart high in the mountains, across the plains, and out to the end of \\nour Exclusive Economic Zone 200 miles offshore. These environments have \\nconsistently worked to protect our shorelines, diffuse and dilute our \\nwastes, remove excess nutrients from our land-based activities, and \\nexcess carbon from our atmosphere, but we are outgrowing the capacity \\nof these environments to protect us and clean up after us. As our \\ngrowing scientific literature is helping us understand just how much \\nour natural environment has helped us to adjust to climate change, it \\nis now time for us to partner fully with that environment to improve \\nthe resilience of our coastal areas moving forward.\\n    As the Director of the Florida Sea Grant College Program, which is \\none of 34 university-based programs nationwide, our network generates \\nsolutions for the issues affecting our Nation's coastal communities \\nthroughout the Atlantic and Pacific (including the Great Lakes and Gulf \\nof Mexico), yielding quantifiable economic, social, and environmental \\nbenefits. The National Sea Grant College Program Act of 1966 authorizes \\nour funding for research, education, and advisory services in any field \\nrelated to the conservation and development of marine resources. Sea \\nGrant is a unique program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \\nAdministration (NOAA) under the Department of Commerce. We are charged \\nwith not just funding research but ensuring that those findings are \\ncommunicated to the public and used by resource managers and coastal \\ncommunities and businesses. We operate across line offices in NOAA and \\nacross state and federal agencies in support of our broad mission. A \\njoint federal, state, and county investment, Sea Grant competitively \\nawards over 90% of appropriated funds to coastal states through issues \\nidentified locally with boots-on-the-ground extension specialists and \\nscience communicators who live in the communities they serve. You can \\nfind more information on Sea Grant in the Sea Grant Association's \\nProgrammatic Request for FY2023 (https://bit.ly/sgaprogrammaticask), \\nincluding planned efforts to extend and upscale efforts to improve \\ncoastal resilience that we are discussing today. Every dollar of \\nfederal investment in Sea Grant must be matched with $0.50 of non-\\nfederal investment, which is a model that fosters cost-effective and \\ncollaborate efforts. As a network, we have documented investments of \\nmore than six times the required match.\\n    In 2020, the Sea Grant program helped generate an estimated $520 \\nmillion in economic benefits, created or supported 11,044 jobs, created \\nor sustained 1,332 businesses, assisted 285 communities improve their \\nresilience, helped restore or protect an estimated 4.2 million acres of \\nhabitat, and supported the education and training of 2,027 \\nundergraduate and graduate students (NSGO, Fall 2021). Aside from \\nmetrics of accomplishment, Sea Grant programs are trusted sources of \\nscientific information and occupy a neutral, partner-building space at \\nthe community level; we are neither regulatory nor fundraising-focused \\nand have a 50-year track record. That consistent presence and support, \\noften in conjunction with our Land Grant partner institutions, provides \\nan invaluable link between the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that \\nhelp us be particularly effective.\\n    Today, I appreciate the opportunity to speak about the climate \\nbenefits of investing in healthy ecosystems, with a focus on coastal \\nand marine ecosystems. While discussing the ecosystem services \\nassociated with forest or agricultural lands is understood by many, the \\nphysical processes of the ocean are not as observable--and yet, our \\noceans are undeniably our biggest asset in the fight against climate \\nchange. Coastal marine ecosystems--mangroves, tidal marshes, and \\nseagrasses \\\\1\\\\--sequester and store large quantities of carbon in both \\nthe plants and the sediment below. In fact, all carbon in seagrass \\nmeadows is stored in the soils, which is why the mounting concern over \\nloss of seagrasses in Florida is more than just for manatees.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Seagrasses are not grasses, they are flowering plants more akin \\nto land-growing lilies or ginger. Their leaves are thin but strong and \\nflexible, which allows the plant to withstand constant movement from \\nwaves and currents; the same movement also disperses their seeds and \\npollen (like land-based plants use bees and wind for pollination). \\nSeagrasses have evolved to grow on the soft, sandy seafloor through a \\nvast network of roots and specialized branching stems that act as \\nanchors and stabilize the sediment.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    According to The Blue Carbon Initiative (http://\\nthebluecarboninitiative.org) 83% of global carbon cycle is circulated \\nthrough the ocean, and coastal habitats account for approximately half \\nof the total carbon that is deposited and stored (i.e., sequestered) in \\nocean sediments. This means there is opportunity to invest in coastal \\nhabitats, which currently only account for less than 2% of the total \\nocean area. That is the ideal scenario, that we only need to invest in \\nmore habitat and rely on photosynthesis and the potential that all \\nplants have to regenerate and support sustainable industries, including \\nplants from the ocean. Which is why Sea Grant has ``Healthy Coastal \\nEcosystems'' as one of four National Focus Areas and has invested in \\nhabitat restoration as mentioned with the metric previously. Florida is \\nno exception; we have grown and replanted new seagrasses, mangroves, \\nand shoreline sea oats, and we have even invested in genetic studies to \\ncreate more effective plant varieties. Plant breeding is not just for \\nfood and fiber crops, and could become a more important tool as we \\nlearn that not all marine vegetation is a net carbon sink because the \\nreality is that respiration releases carbon dioxide. Moreover, if these \\nareas natural areas are disturbed--such as scarring by boat motors or \\nexcessive trimming by oceanfront homeowners--these coastal ecosystems \\nwill release the carbon they have stored (which could have been for \\ncenturies for native habitat), and that carbon returns to the \\natmosphere and contributes to greenhouse gasses that are responsible \\nfor global warming, rising seas and ocean acidification.\\n    As this example shows, we also need research on plant biology and \\nbreeding to maximize the carbon uptake and growth potential. We also \\nneed public education programs, like our ``Seagrass Safe Boating'' \\nthat has recreational boaters take a pledge (http://beseagrasssafe.com/\\n) and ``Mangrove Trimming Best Management Practice'' videos that show \\nthe how and why (https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/FR448). In these \\nprograms, we are not only seeking that the public gain knowledge, we \\nare also providing the education to make them act and change their \\nbehaviors. And that education extends to other efforts that will help \\nmaintain the integrity of natural systems, such as removing invasive \\nspecies (e.g., beach vitex is a wonderful ornamental, but kills native \\nsea oats and is without the root structure needed to stabilize \\nshoreline dunes; https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/escambiaco/2018/06/24/an-\\nunwanted-invasive-plant-beach-vitex/). For some communities, the \\nurgency has led to local ordinances where violations result in fines. \\nThus, sound policy and regulation could be another mechanism to help \\nmaximize atmospheric carbon removal.\\n    But there is more good news. In addition to the carbon \\nsequestration generated from photosynthesis, our oceans help us remove \\ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere through calcification; that is, as \\ncarbon is absorbed from the ocean, the shellfish secretes calcium \\ncarbonate to form its shell (http://oceanacidification.wordpress.com/\\n2008/04/24/can-seashells-save-the-world/), which means a percentage of \\nshells contain carbon. The calcification process thus provides a \\npermanent conversion of carbon dioxide into an insoluble mineral. In \\nother words, the calcium carbonate from shellfish and in particular \\nbivalves like oysters, clams, scallops, and mussels can persist \\nindefinitely as limestone. This is promising: molluscan shellfish \\naquaculture has two products--food for humans and long-term storage of \\ngreenhouse gases. In contrast, the carbon contained in most plant and \\nanimal tissues return to carbon dioxide in a few years. Moreover, \\nshellfish aquaculture practices do not produce merely the shell-bearing \\nanimals (such as oysters and clams with commercial value), but there \\nare additional hard materials associated with external growth (often \\nknown as ``biofouling'') that is costly for farmers to remove but \\nbeneficial for society due to its carbon capture properties. The post-\\nconsumption shells are an industry byproduct with value in \\nconstruction, restoration, and potentially even for making decorative \\ntiles like a partner institution in South America. However, just \\nbecause there are carbon sink properties, and other societal benefits, \\ndoes not mean that research is no longer needed. The lead author of a \\nrecent study concluded that, ``If you want to create jobs and income, \\ngrow oysters to feed people and provide habitat for other species, and \\nthat can be done anywhere that's suitable to oyster reef development. \\nBut if you want to sequester carbon, near shore is the best bet.'' \\n(Fodrie et al. 2017). In short, location matters.\\n    Sea Grant, especially in Florida, has long provided outreach \\nsupport to individuals that want to become shellfish growers, but from \\nthe perspective of support- \\ning a financially sustainable and profitable industry. This support \\nincludes the provision of habitats, in part through assisting in the \\npermitting and licensing \\nprocess, and potentially the need to protect the juvenile shellfish \\nfrom predation. We are now seeing the opportunity to manage growing \\noperations with environmental benefits in mind. Farming in the sea \\ndoesn't require irrigation, food, or fertilizer, but does require \\nplanning, permitting, and education that is not readily available or \\npassed down between generations. And for new crops and shellfish \\nproducts (https://shellfish.ifas.ufl.edu/sunray-venus-clams/project-\\nvenus/), Sea Grant has also helped introduce consumers and chefs to \\nthese new supplies so marketing can also be a tool to promote growth in \\ncarbon sequestering shellfish production.\\n    So far, I have focused on the potential carbon sequestration \\nbenefits of shellfish aquaculture, but I would be remiss to not share \\nthat these systems also provide equal promise in removing excess \\nnutrients, like nitrogen, and there is tremendous potential to foster a \\nnutrient credit training program. To that end, Florida Sea Grant \\nrecently used COVID-19 relief funding to purchase market sized clams \\nthat have sized out of retail markets for their nutrient management \\nfunctions and monitor those functions under a research experiment \\n(https://www.flseagrant.org/clams/and https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/news/\\n2019/12/09/uf-researchers-team-up-with-florida-aquarium-for-noaa-\\nproject-part-of-coral-reef-restoration-initiative/). While this \\npractice--of having multiple and complementary markets for hard clams--\\nwould seem the ideal solution, current regulations prohibit this \\npractice, which is a long way of saying that permitting and regulatory \\nrevisions could be a prudent investment as efforts like the new ``All \\nClams on Deck'' (https://www.allclamsondeck.org/) develop. The \\ndevelopment of such programs would mimic efforts proposed by USDA for \\nland-based agriculture, such as the Partnerships for Climate-Smart \\nCommodities (https://www.usda.gov/climate-solutions/climate-smart-\\ncommodities) or those of Solutions for the Land (https://\\nwww.solutionsfromtheland.org/flcsa/), dubbed a ``renaissance'' in \\nproduction with a focus on innovation, entrepreneurship, and advanced \\nenvironmental sustainability objectives.\\n    Now you might be thinking, what about other invertebrates such as \\ncorals, sponges, and sea urchins? In fact, Florida Sea Grant is \\ninvesting in all three with a focus on restoration (e.g., https://\\nwww.flseagrant.org/wp-content/uploads/\\nSGEF_215_SpongeRestoration_web.pdf and https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/news/\\n2019/12/09/uf-researchers-team-up-with-florida-aquarium-for-noaa-\\nproject-part-of-coral-reef-restoration-initiative/). At first glance, \\nit would seem obvious that other invertebrates also might serve as \\ncarbon ``sinks'' (i.e., net consumers of carbon). In fact, like \\nshellfish and seagrasses, the benefits are driven by a multitude of \\nfactors that justify the need for both theoretical and applied (site-\\nspecific) research to identify, measure, and ultimately document the \\nnet carbon effects of habitat restoration efforts (especially in \\nregards to current water quality conditions).\\\\2\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\2\\\\ The scientific evidence is clear on the value of preserving and \\nrestoring coral reefs aside \\nfrom carbon sequestration (https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4794, \\nand https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00706-6). Benefits \\ninclude reducing coastal flooding and associated damage to \\ninfrastructure and loss of human life, and there are several promising \\ninnovations that could translate to other invertebrates.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Augmenting and extending habitats through targeted species-specific \\nrestoration, incentivizing, and promoting the growth of shellfish that \\nabsorb atmospheric carbon can only take us so far, which is why we've \\nmoved toward the development, training, and practice of ``Living \\nShorelines'' or LSLs. A ``Living shoreline'' (https://\\nfloridalivingshorelines.com/) is a broad term used to describe a range \\nof nature-based approaches to stabilize a shoreline. In suitable \\nenvironments, living shorelines can be used instead of seawalls or \\nbulkheads to reduce erosion and \\nprotect property. Living shoreline projects are made up of mostly \\nnatural mate- \\nrials, such as native wetland vegetation, natural fiber logs, or oyster \\nreef break- \\nwaters, thus maintaining natural shoreline features--and utilizing the \\ncarbon \\nsequestration properties of the plants and shellfish. In Florida, these \\nconfigura- \\ntions predominantly utilize salt marshes, mangroves, and oysters \\n(http://floridalivingshorelines.com/types-of-living-shorelines/). \\nAccording to NOAA, a living shoreline is:\\n\\n        ``A shoreline management practice that provides erosion control \\n        benefits; protects, restores, or enhances natural shoreline \\n        habitat; and maintains coastal processes through the strategic \\n        placement of plants, stone, sand fill, and other structural \\n        organic materials (e.g. biologs, oyster reefs, etc.).'' \\n        (https://shoreline.noaa.gov/glossary.html#partj)\\n\\n    As you have likely surmised, every LSL should be the result of \\nthoughtful, careful consideration of each project site and strategic \\nplacement of natural components along the shoreline profile. As a \\nresult, coastal property owners have a menu of potential solutions \\navailable for solving erosion problems--it's not just seawalls anymore! \\nAnd, in fact, every site needs a ``green-to-grey'' assessment to \\ndetermine the range of vegetation, edging, sills, breakwater \\nstructures, revetment and bulkheads that are most suitable. Sea Grant \\nhas attempted to foster the adoption of this technique (and seawall \\nreplacement) by both educating homeowners \\\\3\\\\ and by developing a \\nworkforce training module--dubbed the Marine Contractors training \\n(https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/ncbs/2021/01/07/living-shorelines-for-\\nmarine-contractors-virtual-course-this-month/) to foster development of \\na new industry and upscale efforts to combat atmospheric carbon.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ The FMNP includes two courses, each with 24 contact hours, \\ndeveloped by Florida Sea Grant Extension agents that increase education \\nof restoration (https://masternaturalist.ifas.ufl.edu/become-a-master-\\nnaturalist/master-naturalist-courses/): (1) Coastal Shoreline \\nRestoration, and \\n(2) Marine Habitat Restoration.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    This homeowner education program was recently recognized at the \\nnational level by the Association of Natural Resource Extension \\nProfessionals (ANREP) and received the Gold Award in the Outstanding \\nEducational Materials category for a Book or Comprehensive Program \\nCurriculum for the FMNP Marine Habitat Restoration Special Topics \\nCourse. The program provides detailed information on the ecology, \\nbenefits, restoration methods, and monitoring of marine habitats in \\nFlorida. A team of six faculty created the course curriculum, focused \\non restoration of seagrasses, coral reefs, sponges, and marine \\nenhancement through artificial reefs. The companion video series \\nconsisting of four videos, each between 10 and 26 minutes long also \\ngarnered the Silver Award for the TV and Video category.\\n    With the goal of shoreline restoration, it might be easy to \\noverlook that the methods and materials matter. Sea Grant is committed \\nto also helping clean nearshore and offshore aquatic systems, including \\nfrom plastics. We have a long-standing micro plastics awareness program \\n(https://flseagrant.ifas.ufl.edu/microplastics/) \\nand strive to reduce the use of plastics in our own programs. One \\nexamples is \\nPROS--a Partnership for Plastic-free Restoration of Oyster Shorelines \\n(https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/ncbs/2021/09/03/a-partnership-for-pros-\\nplastic-free-restoration-of-oyster-shorelines/\\n#:\\x0b:text=This%20project%20is%20called%20the,free%20material \\n%20called%20reef%20prisms.). This partnership resulted from faculty \\nresearch project that sought to improve upon the most common LSL \\nconfiguration, that is, creating reefs by stacking up rows of ``shell \\nbags'' (oyster shell contained in plastic nylon mesh sacks). Given that \\nthe bags can release microplastics into the marine environment, \\nresearchers sought a new design and Reef Prisms were born. This new \\ndesign uses jute fiber instead of plastic and an adhesive that is free \\nof additives and readily available from local big box stores; an \\noutcome that reduces costs, increases availability of materials and \\nhelps local economies--in addition to providing an alternative career \\npath. You see, the development of a Blue Economy is also an \\nunprecedented opportunity for workforce development and mechanism to \\nhelp address diversity, equity and inclusion objectives at the \\ncommunity level; if we don't consider the opportunity now, the Blue \\neconomy could leave the underserved even further behind.\\n    I hope you are beginning to see the value of LSLs for both the \\nenvironment, coastal property owners, and coastal economies. \\nInvestments in habitat restoration improve the health of coastal \\necosystems and reduce coastal waves and erosion that mitigate the \\neconomic impacts of sea level rise--and they do it at a much lower \\ncost. But to make those projects come to fruition, we need local \\nprograms, communities, and planners to learn about their potential. Sea \\nGrant has worked hard, through its boots-on-the-ground outreach, to \\nengage with the public and local planners. For example, we have a \\nClimate Smart Floridians program (https://sites.google.com/ufl.edu/\\nclimatesmartflorida/climate-smart-floridians-program) to provide \\ncitizens research-based information about climate change and engage \\nthem as volunteers to help reduce household expenses and personal \\ngreenhouse gas emissions; topics include landscaping, water resources, \\ntransportation, home energy, food and waste and highlights the impacts \\nof individual choices on climate change. And one of our agents works \\nclosely with the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council and is a member of \\ntheir Technical Advisory Committee; those efforts have resulted in the \\ndevelopment of a shoreline suitability model for the siting of LSLs. \\nWorking directly with communities has also been the objective of \\nprojects designed to develop flood resilient upgrades to natural \\nbuffers around transportation corridors near the Space Coast. Such \\nprojects change the aesthetics of an area and, as such, need local \\nresident support and policy makers willing to invest in new designs. \\nFinally, the Gulf Sea Grant programs have partnered with local \\norganizations and agencies for more than a decade in hosting an annual \\nclimate ``community of practice'' meeting where we bring together \\nscientists, outreach professionals, and local leaders and decision \\nmakers to identify solutions to climate related challenges facing \\ncommunities today and anticipated to impact them tomorrow.\\n    So, this is a great story of a win, win, win scenario for the \\nenvironment (and all its natural dependents), the pubic that lives on \\nor near coastal areas, and the entire nation's economy as costs (and \\nlives) are saved. The reality is that to generate societal benefits, a \\nlot of pieces need to be in place--other than just funding the growth \\nand replanting or stocking of plants and animals--namely:\\n\\n    <bullet>  Site specific research on the physical and biological \\nsciences behind carbon capture, storage, and release--for living \\nshorelines and its component species such as seagrasses and shellfish \\nto inform the development of interventions that includes:\\n\\n      <ctr-circle>  quantifying the net carbon effects,\\n      <ctr-circle>  estimating the feasibility and economic values of \\nalternative solutions, and\\n      <ctr-circle>  advises on the needed policies and or regulations.\\n\\n    <bullet>  Education to students to encourage careers in natural \\ncoastal solutions to climate change and homeowners, policy makers, and \\nrelevant industry sectors with the goal of behavioral change.\\n    <bullet>  Training and workforce development to upscale our \\ncapacity to grow and support a new Blue economy that benefits all \\nAmericans, and especially the underserved.\\n\\n    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to share the \\naccomplishments, priorities, and ongoing activities of our Sea Grant \\nprogram. You can find more information on many of the projects I \\ndescribed through links in the written testimony, but if you should \\nhave more questions or desire more information, please feel free to \\ncontact me directly. As a final caveat, as a program that is charged \\nwith (and embraces) developing partnerships to leverage resources, I \\nspeak on behalf of not just Florida Sea Grant, or the network of Sea \\nGrant programs nationwide, but for all of our partners in these efforts \\nsince we do none of this alone. And I thank all of our unrecognized \\npartners at this time.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n    Fodrie, J. F., A. B. A. B. Rodriguez, R. K. Gittman, J. H. \\nGrabowski, N. L. Lindquist, C. H. Peterson, M. F.

CRISTINA EISENBERG\\n\\n    Dr. Eisenberg. I want to thank Chair Castor, Ranking Member \\nGraves, and the others members of the Select Committee on \\nClimate Crisis for this opportunity to speak.\\n    To create ecosystems more resilient to climate change \\nincluding drought and other stressors, it is essential to \\npartner with Tribal Nations and braid traditional ecological \\nknowledge with Western science. Our Fort Belknap Indian \\nCommunity Grassland Restoration Project in Montana exemplifies \\nsuch work. Taking place on BLM land and Aaniiihnen and Nakoda \\nTribal lands, funded by the conservation and restoration \\nprogram lead Peggy Olwell, using Seeds of Success protocols, \\nthis project is sponsored by Oregon State University and the \\nSociety for Ecological Restoration.\\n    I am the lead Principal Investigator and Thomas H. DeLuca, \\nDean of the Oregon State University College of Forestry, is the \\nco-PI. The Fort Belknap Tribal Council, Tribal Historical \\nPreservation Office, BLM Montana/Dakotas botanist Wendy Velman \\noversees our project.\\n    TEK is knowledge and practices generate and passed down by \\nindigenous people across generations. We are applying TEK on \\nthe Northern Great Planes to improve ecological resiliency and \\nrestore degraded lands with native plants to increase wildlife \\nhabitat, productivity, and carbon sequestration potential.\\n    Incorporating TEK in ecocultural restoration empowers \\nTribal Nations. This matters because Tribal Nations in America \\nare underserved communities with unemployment, poverty, and \\nsuicide rates far higher than U.S. rates. Ours is also a high-\\npriority project because this prairie is a critical carbon sink \\nand endangered by anthropogenic climate change.\\n    We deploy a Tribal conservation corps of at-risk youth to \\ncollect the seeds of ecologically and culturally significant \\nplants strictly protected by Tribal data-sovereignty. We are \\nimplementing the National Seed Strategy and Plant Conservation \\nand Restoration Program by following SOS protocols to ensure a \\nstable economical supply of native plant materials for public \\nland restoration. We are collecting data for BLM Assessment, \\nInventory and Monitoring protocols to assess public lands. \\nMaintaining healthy, sustainable ecosystems supports diverse \\nland uses and benefits the national public lands trust.\\n    Over the first 2 years of the project, fiscal year 2020 and \\n2021, outcomes include 45 jobs created, 94 percent of them for \\nNative Americans, 39 of which were for Tribal youth, totaling \\n15,000 hours of employment. We raised $200,000 in external and \\nin-kind funding and collected 25 pounds of seeds for \\necocultural restoration. Youth on our projects have stayed \\nalive and in school and some have begun college.\\n    Beyond these tangible outcomes, during a Category 4 drought \\nin 2021, I received a major lesson. On BLM land, I found ankle-\\nheight grasses. In few places where plants had bloomed, their \\nseedpods were hollow because the plants had suppressed growth \\nbecause of the drought to survive.\\n    On Tribal land, in the same ecological conditions, the \\ngrasses grew 4 feet tall with an abundance of seed. The stark \\ndifference was unattributable to cattle. Both Tribal and BLM \\nlands were multiple-use lands subject to cattle raising \\ndocumented by our trail cameras.\\n    Co-PI Tom DeLuca, a soil scientist, and I will be looking \\nat fire and other land management practices and their impacts \\non soils. Charcoal in the soil, created by low-severity fires \\nset by indigenous people, sustains soil carbon capital and \\nincreases nutrient availability and drought resiliency. When \\nTribal lands were stolen and settled throughout the U.S., fires \\nwere suppressed. Indigenous burning is a key TEK practice and \\nused globally to improve soil health.\\n    The next step is to create an ecocultural restoration plan \\nwith Fort Belknap that includes native seed collection, \\nethnobotany, and pollinator and soil health studies. The plan \\nwill contribute to the Fort Belknap climate change program. We \\nhave applied for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Grassland \\nConservation Program funding for this work.\\n    Ecocultural restoration partnerships can advance our \\nnational climate resiliency agenda. This requires building \\ncapacity with education and jobs in botany, soil science, \\nentomology, forestry, and ecological restoration for Native \\nAmericans.\\n    OSU can deliver the necessary education and in partnership \\nwith Federal agencies, Tribal Nations, and non-Tribal \\nlandowner. Together we can empower Tribal Nations and help \\nAmerica meet the climate challenge.\\n    Thank you.\\n    [The statement of Dr. Eisenberg follows:]\\n\\n                 Select Committee on the Climate Crisis\\n\\n                    Dr. Cristina Eisenberg Testimony\\n\\n                         April 1, 2022 Hearing\\n\\n                     America's Natural Solutions: \\n         The Climate Benefit of Investing in Healthy Ecosystems\\n\\n    My name is Cristina Eisenberg.

Thank you, Dr. Eisenberg.\\n    And thanks to all of our witnesses for your insightful \\ntestimony.\\n    And, without objection, all of the witness testimony will \\nbe incorporated into the record.\\n    Now we will turn to member questions, and I will recognize \\nmyself for the first 5 minutes.\\n    Well, we know that wetland and forest and ecosystem \\nrestoration and conservation is critical to adaptation and \\nmitigation over time. But it is also, as many of you \\nhighlighted, it is also vitally important to capturing carbon \\nand sequestering carbon. Just a few weeks ago, the world's top \\nscientists said we must act urgently to reduce carbon \\npollution. There is a rapidly closing window for us to avoid \\ncatastrophic impacts and the rising costs of the climate \\ncrisis.\\n    So I want to know: How do we do that? What is working right \\nnow? The Federal level, helping states and local communities, \\nall in partnership, how do we make sure that we are getting the \\nbest bang for the buck, the Federal dollar that we are \\ninvesting in natural solutions to sequester carbon? And how do \\nwe prioritize?\\n    Mr. O'Mara.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. I mean, over the last several--especially in \\nthe wake of several hurricane seasons in the last several \\nyears, I mean, at this point, we have such great evidence in \\nkind of the projects that have been successful and the projects \\nthat haven't.\\n    There is a lot of--back in the Sandy package, you know, a \\ndecade ago, there is a whole bunch of mountain monitoring that \\nwas done to kind of look at the health of these systems, to \\nkind of make the case that they are truly achieving the \\nresilience goals and some of the, you know, carbon goals that \\nwe have.\\n    And I think it is just a matter of, you know, doing that \\ndeep research in the early investments that are made. There is \\nhuge opportunities in the bipartisan infrastructure package to \\nlook at the forest restoration projects, look at some of the \\ngrasslands projects, look at some of the flood abatement \\nprograms, and make sure that they are actually achieving the \\ngoals.\\n    And what we are finding is that they are cheaper, they are \\nmore durable, and achieve more co-benefits than a lot of the \\ntraditional manmade solutions. And there are some solutions \\nwhere the natural makes sense. There is some places where the \\nstructural makes sense. There is some places where a blend \\ndoes.\\n    But there is a lot of good data now to kind of show us the \\ntypes of public infrastructure investments that really should \\nprioritize natural investments maybe over some of the last \\ncentury solutions.\\n    Ms. Castor. And, Dr. Larkin, you are well-versed in those \\npartnerships. There are so many funding streams that come from \\nFederal initiatives, down to State and localities.\\n    How are we being the most efficient and making sure at this \\nurgent moment in time that those dollars really are going to \\nthe best projects to sequester carbon and to make our \\ncommunities more resilient?\\n    Dr. Larkin. Thank you, Congresswoman Castor. That is a \\ngreat question.\\n    And I think we have, like the previous speaker said, we \\nhave a lot of mechanisms to follow up and track. I think we do \\na much better job now of tracking and quantifying outcomes. The \\nscience has helped us progress to the point where we can \\nactually get to the economic value of those outcomes.\\n    I do see a trend in terms of making more impact in these \\nintegrated calls for proposals where you are tasked to go out \\nand have local groups on the ground, and you are tasked to \\nbring different parts of the Federal Government together. So we \\noften work not just within NOAA--but within projects with the \\nDepartment of Defense and the EPA, and I think those funding \\nmechanisms and those language that really charge us to go out \\nand develop a network of partnerships are where you see a lot \\nof the impact happening.\\n    Ms. Castor. So we see it in partnership, for example, with \\nfarmers through agricultural extension. We see it in some of \\nthe land conservation programs.\\n    But, Dr. Larkin, there are so many communities that just do \\nnot have the capacity to go and fight for the Federal grants. \\nWhat do we need to be doing to make sure that lower income \\ncommunities, rural areas understand that they are--they have a \\npartnership and can access the investments and tools they need?\\n    Dr. Larkin. That is really good.\\n    First, I would say, you know, I think we are lucky that we \\nsit with our Land Grant partners, Land and Sea Grant. We have \\nthose boots on the ground.\\n    I think in developing partnerships, well, so one thing, we \\ngo where the problems are. And we are not big enough to go out \\nand reach out to every company. No agency is--or every \\norganization. So we have to rely on ``training the trainer'' \\nprogram almost, like, where if we help one community, we help \\nthat community develop another community.\\n    I think when you look at the force multiplier effect, for \\ninstance, or organic--the notion of organic growth is we set \\nsome models in motion. That success breeds more success, and I \\nthink that is one area that we are most excited in because \\napplying for Federal money is not easy. So helping that \\ncapacity is definitely right. But when we help that capacity, \\nhelp them with one grant, they will then have the capacity to \\ngo after the next one. So we really hope that that grassroots \\nwill pay off in the long run.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you very much.\\n    Next we will go to Mrs. Miller.\\n    You are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mrs. Miller. Thank you, Chair Castor and Ranking Member \\nGraves. And thank you to our witnesses for being here today.\\n    West Virginia is a--it is just so well-known to be one of \\nthe most beautiful locations in the country, if not the world.\\n    In southern West Virginia, we highly prize our environment. \\nAnd we know that the beauty of our State lies both in our \\ngeography and in our abundant natural resources. I was proud to \\nbe a sponsor of the bill to designate the New River Gorge as \\nour nation's newest national park.\\n    My community has seen a huge increase in the attention and \\nin the tourism from so many Americans, as well as visitors from \\naround the world, who have had the opportunity to encounter \\nWest Virginia for the very first time. In fact, 600,000 more \\npeople visited the New River Gorge National Park this year than \\nthe year before. That is over 1.7 million people.\\n    I am so proud of the abundant resources, the natural \\nresources that my state has to offer. From the clean coal to \\nthe high-quality oil and natural gas, we power the nation and \\nthe world. And we have provided a livelihood for so many people \\nin our state.\\n    And I am really proud of my neighbors who, they are kind, \\nloving, hardworking Americans who have been doing their best to \\nget by no matter what our government tries to throw at them.\\n    Unfortunately, West Virginians know all too well that the \\ngovernment doesn't always offer the best solution. That is why \\nI think it is so important to empower the private sector to get \\nto work. Streamlining permitting processes across a variety of \\nsectors is something Congress could do right now to expand \\nenergy deliverability, expand opportunities of the timber \\ndevelopment, and produce more right here at home while we are \\nproviding jobs and opportunities for many of my constituents.\\n    Mr. Loris, can you explain how the National Environmental \\nPolicy Act, known as the NEPA process, has become so burdensome \\nover the last 50 years? And what can Congress do to help \\nstreamline the process?\\n    Mr. Loris. Yeah, thank you for the question.\\n    You know, the National Environmental Policy Act, you know, \\nis more than 50 years old. And, you know, it is certainly well-\\nintentioned and served its purpose. I think, since then, we \\nhave seen a number of Federal environmental laws passed and \\namended, a number of State environmental laws passed and \\namended.\\n    And I think what the problem with NEPA is that it has \\nbecome a tool to obstruct and delay or to challenge projects in \\ncourt. And there has been a number of documented cases, \\nparticularly with forest restoration. For instance, a Property \\nand Environment Research Center report in April of 2021 \\ndocumented some really troubling ones where projects took years \\nand years and are still held up in courts.\\n    And so the more we can have, again, an efficient permitting \\nprocess that, again, still engages stakeholders, still engages \\ncommunities, still allows, you know, litigation to happen but \\nbe challenged and resolved more quickly will allow for more of \\nthese projects to happen efficiently.\\n    I think there is several legislative ideas out there. \\nRepresentative Graves with the BUILDER Act, Senator Mike Lee \\nwith the UNSHACKLE Act, that would still have this \\nenvironmental accountability and safeguards but allow projects, \\nagain, not just for forest restoration and timber development, \\nbut also it will help with clean energy projects, more \\ntransmission lines, more liquefied natural gas exports, which \\nare cleaner than Russian piped gas.\\n    This is one issue in which I have heard from, you know, \\npeople who are working on forest restoration, energy \\ndevelopers, manufacturers all run into these challenges. And \\nthe quicker we can resolve this issue, I think the more we can \\nwork with urgency to provide economic and environmental \\nbenefits.\\n    Mrs. Miller. I agree.\\n    In your testimony, you mention the possibilities that \\ncarbon offsets can provide to companies who are looking to \\nreduce their carbon footprint.\\n    Can you explain in more detail some of the opportunities \\nand challenges that are presented by the carbon offsets, along \\nwith their effectiveness?\\n    Mr. Loris. Yeah, I think these voluntary carbon offset \\nmarkets, you can provide flexibility to engage with companies \\nand nonprofits and entrepreneurs, a lot of climate \\nentrepreneurs, who are motivated by reducing emissions to \\nultimately reduce their environmental footprint and reduce \\nemissions. And the people who are doing that will then get paid \\nfor it. So it is certainly a win-win.\\n    And I think there have been concerns about carbon offsets, \\nprimarily the validity of them, as well as, you know, if a \\nrestoration project for forests or a forestation project \\nhappens and it burns down, what does that mean for the offsets \\nor--and there has been some challenges with validity.\\n    But those concerns, I think a lot them have been alleviated \\nby the work of the private sector by nonprofits in terms of we \\nhave better technology now. We can use drones and satellite \\nimagery and better data to verify that these offset projects \\nare happening.\\n    I think another concern is the concept of additionality \\nwhich, you know, are people getting paid for something they \\nwere going to do otherwise? And it is very difficult to prove a \\ncounterfactual there.\\n    But that said, I think the fact that carbon offsets provide \\nthis flexibility and market-based mechanism for some companies \\nwho have a very challenging task ahead to reduce emissions is \\nsomething that results in more productive relationships.\\n    The more we can have the private sector taking the lead on \\nthat, which I think is what has happened, I think the better \\noff we are going to be. I think the role for the Federal \\nGovernment should be limited in ensuring that these are \\nverifiable carbon credits and to prevent things like the \\nChinese flooding the markets with fake credits. There is a role \\nthere, but I think it should be pretty limited.\\n    Mrs. Miller. Thank you.\\n    I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Rep Bonamici, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Ms. Bonamici. Thank you so much, Chair Castor and Ranking \\nMember Graves, for holding this important hearing. And thank \\nyou to the witnesses for your expertise.\\n    In November, this committee held a hearing, examining \\nTribal perspective on the climate crisis. I asked a question \\nabout the announcement from the White House Council on \\nEnvironmental Quality and the Office of Science and Technology \\nPolicy about the administration's commitment to elevating \\nindigenous traditional ecological knowledge the Federal \\npolicymaking process.\\n    Early last month, the White House announced that the \\nadministration will be developing guidance to lift up \\ntraditional ecological knowledge in Federal decisionmaking.\\n    So, Dr. Eisenberg, you have substantial experience with \\ntraditional ecological knowledge. What are the lessons learned \\nand the best practices that should inform the development of \\nthis guidance?\\n    Dr. Eisenberg. Thank you for that question, Representative \\nBonamici.\\n    I was actually present at some of the meetings that you \\njust mentioned. And I am very actively involved with the \\nprocess of providing guidance on how to use indigenous \\ntraditional ecological knowledge, or TEK as it is referred to \\nby the scientific community.\\n    We need to have government-to-government relationships. \\nThat means Tribal Nations are not stakeholders. A stakeholder \\nis a member of the public. Tribal Nations are nations, and so \\nthat means honoring sovereignty rights in all aspects of our \\npartnerships with them.\\n    Tribal Nations very much, all the Tribal Nations I have \\nworked with around the world, want to partner with federal \\ngovernments and nonprofits. But it needs to be decolonized, \\nthis process. So we need to all sit at the table as equals.\\n    TEK is--it is our native science, but it is also a world \\nview, and it includes ethics and so that everyone is equal and \\nthe living world needs to be respected equally. And this is \\nwithin the context of multiple uses.\\n    So one of the things that can help advance this is to \\nintegrate our cultures, our elders in all the conversations. \\nAnd the White House is really leading with this. The White \\nHouse Council on Environmental Quality, some of those meetings \\nhave been held by Secretary Haaland. And she really embodies \\nthese principles in how--in her leadership style.\\n    Ultimately what we want is a conservation corps of \\nindigenous people out on the landscape. Our TEK, our ecological \\nknowledge, is the way our Nation's lands, what is today the \\nUnited States of America, have been managed for millennia. So \\nall of our grasslands, all of our forests, all of our coastal \\necosystems co-involved with a large population of Indigenous \\npeople very actively managing those lands.\\n    And the grasslands----\\n    Ms. Bonamici. I am sorry. I don't mean to cut you off, but \\nI really want to get another question in. We will continue \\nconversation at another time, and I may ask to you submit more \\nfor the record because we have a lot to learn.\\n    Dr. Larkin, I am the co-chair of the House Oceans and \\nEstuary Caucus. I have long advocated for elevating the role of \\nmarine and estuarial ecosystems in adapting and mitigating the \\neffects of climate change, because we know of the potential \\nwhich you, of course, have recognized to reduce flooding, \\nreduce the intensity of storms, sequester carbon, and generate \\ngood-paying jobs.\\n    I do want to invite all of my colleagues on the committee \\nand beyond to sign onto my bipartisan Blue Carbon for Our Plant \\nAct.\\n    So, Dr. Larkin, in your testimony, you cite training and \\nworkforce development as necessary components of an effective \\nnatural climate solutions toolkit. So what are the current \\nworkforce challenges you and your colleagues have experienced, \\nand how can Congress help you close the gap?\\n    Dr. Larkin. Well, thank you. Thank you.\\n    So you are absolutely right. The training and workforce \\ndevelopment is the key to our future as we try to draw new \\nstudents in and develop new programs.\\n    I think one of our challenges is finding our partners. But \\nthe good news is, because these solutions can be implemented at \\nthe local level all the way up to the State level, the fact \\nthat we do have partnerships at every one of those levels and \\nwith our state organizations. For us, it is the Florida \\nDepartment of Environmental Protection and the Fish and \\nWildlife Service.\\n    And, even as we try to develop programs that can be \\nincorporated into our curricula, start training students to \\nthink about these as careers moving up, how do we do that? \\nWell, in high schools in Florida there is a curriculum process, \\nand it is not necessarily easy to break into.\\n    So right now we are working on trying to help support the \\ndevelopment of an aquaculture curriculum, because aquaculture--\\nseveral different types of aquaculture, and how do we develop a \\ncurriculum around that so that the STEM courses in high school \\nand those AP courses can use these examples as part of their \\nlearning tool, and maybe plant a seed that, after high school, \\nthis is something I can do, or maybe I will want to be a \\nresearcher and go on in my education.\\n    So I think it is interesting, because that does take our \\nState partners, it takes our local partners, and it takes the \\nfolks that are working in the area to really see what is that \\ntype of that project?\\n    You know, these projects are so site specific, so we need \\ntheoretical and applied research at the site level. Because \\nwhat happens in one bay is so different than what happens in \\nanother in terms of the outcomes that we are going to receive.\\n    And that should really resonate with our workforce. So, as \\nwe share our communications around the State, we really need to \\ntailor them around the State to get the folks and the table to \\nfigure out which one of these workforce programs might work \\nbest for you. We can't----\\n    Ms. Bonamici. Thank you, Dr. Larkin. I see my time has \\nexpired, and I really appreciate your response as a member of \\nthe Education Committee as well.\\n    Ms. Castor. Your time has expired.\\n    Ms. Bonamici. I yield back. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    Ms. Castor. Next up, Mr. Carter.\\n    You are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    And thank all of the witnesses for being here.\\n    I know it is going to be a surprise to my colleagues on \\nthis committee, but I want to talk about forestry. And the \\nreason I want to talk about forestry is because Georgia is the \\nnumber one forestry state in the nation.\\n    Georgia has over 22 million acres of commercially available \\nprivate timberland, more than any other state. And each of \\nthose acres serves as a carbon sink. You see here? Trees are \\nthe answer. Trees are the answers. Because forests serve as \\ncarbon sinks. They serve as a water filter, as an air filter, \\nas well as a habitat for wildlife.\\n    In fact, Mr. Loris, in your testimony, you said that fully \\nrestoring understocked productive forestland in the U.S. could \\nincrease carbon sequestration by 20 percent--by 20 percent.\\n    Bruce Westerman, Representative Westerman, the Ranking \\nMember on Natural Resources, has a bill called the Trillion \\nTrees Act. We are trying to make sure that we plant a trillion \\ntrees. It is a great, great bill, a great effort.\\n    And one of the problems that we are facing is ensuring that \\nforests remain forests, because landowners can use their land \\nfor just about anything to make a living, and they do. But, \\nunfortunately, due to natural disasters, hurricanes, fires, a \\nlot of times after they have this natural disaster, they don't \\nput it back into forestland. And that is what we need to \\nencourage them to do.\\n    So I have got legislation that is cosponsored by \\nRepresentative Sewell from Alabama. It is called the Disaster \\nReforestation Act. And this will help fix a portion of the Tax \\nCode that makes it difficult for forest landowners to continue \\nusing their land for forest.\\n    I want to ask you, Mr. Loris, what are some other barriers \\nto expanding and maintaining our forests, both public and \\nprivate forestland?\\n    Mr. Loris. Yeah. Yeah. I think that the two challenges are \\nwe need to protect the ones we have got. And there are a number \\nof policy fixes that I think could help with timber \\nharvesting--removing export bans on timber harvesting that \\noccurs on Federal lands; expanding acreage limits for \\ncategorical exclusions for controlled or prescribed burns; \\nexcluding State-level air quality emission standards for \\nprescribed burns as well, which would just be a temporary fix.\\n    But to allow a prescribed burn to happen on a good day \\nwhere it is not windy is a temporary fix to ensuring that we \\ndon't have worse environmental and climate outcomes as a result \\nof a more intense natural disaster in a wildfire.\\n    And then I think to your other point is planting more. \\nThere is a number of provisions within the Trillion Trees Act--\\nmatching grant programs to provide seeds and saplings for \\nStates, for nonprofits, for Tribes to continue to plant more \\ntrees.\\n    And I think the more we could also expand afforestation \\nefforts as part of remediation of abandoned mine sites. There \\nare thousands of mine sites that need environmental \\nremediation. And the more we could inject natural climate \\nsolutions into that remediation--and there is some good \\nlegislation that will remove some of the environmental \\nliability risk associated with environmental mine land cleanup, \\nthe better off we are going to be.\\n    Mr. Carter. Good. Well, thank you.\\n    Well, one thing I know that we can do is to expand the use \\nof wood and the wood products as a renewable resource. And that \\nwould both ensure that there is always a market for working \\nforests, keeping them economically viable, and that we continue \\nto grow trees that pull CO<INF>2</INF> out of the atmosphere.\\n    Mr. Loris, can you speak very quickly to the environmental \\nbenefits of using wood and forest products and how we could \\nfurther incentivize this, specifically about the lifecycle of \\nemissions?\\n    This is one thing that I think we miss that point. When \\npeople talk about biomass, they think, ``Oh, you are burning \\nsomething, therefore it is putting carbon in the atmosphere. No \\nway it can be environmentally friendly.'' But, if you look at \\nthe whole lifecycle, it indeed is.\\n    Mr. Loris.\\n    Mr. Loris. Yeah, that is right. I think we can expand the \\nuse of wood projects to continue to utilize wood as a safe, \\nenvironmentally sustainable product.\\n    And, again, that is where I think some of the legislative \\nopportunities to enhance the availability of wood projects, \\nwhether that is through ARC legislation that would enhance \\nopportunities for these kind of new, more efficient types of \\nwood, and even harvesting younger trees is still going to be \\nbetter off from an environmental standpoint.\\n    And, if you would look at what the alternative might be in \\nterms of using cement or other products that are more emissions \\nintense, you are still going to be better off from an \\nenvironmental and climate standpoint.\\n    So not only does it provide economic opportunities, but it \\nprovides environmental benefits.\\n    Mr. Carter. Okay. Well, good.\\n    Again, trees are the answer. Remember what they say back \\nhome, Madam Chair. When you breathe fresh air, get down on your \\nknees and thank the farmer who planted the trees.\\n    God bless America. And I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Mr. Carter, you are giving me visions of The \\nLorax and Thneeds and Truffula trees and the Once-ler. And I \\nknow--what did they say? Unless someone cares a whole awful \\nlot, nothing is going to get better, it is not. So let's all \\ntake that to heart today.\\n    And now we will go to Rep. Levin for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Levin. I am not sure if I can follow my friend, Buddy \\nCarter. But thank you, Chair Castor.\\n    As a Representative for California, I want to highlight how \\nnatural solutions can and must play a key role in addressing \\nsome of the pressing environmental challenges, particularly \\nthose facing California.\\n    First, let me start off with natural solutions to address \\nwildfire risk. Over the last 4 years, California communities \\nhave suffered from seven of the largest fires in State history. \\nAgain, that is just over the last 4 years.\\n    These fires have collectively burned over 2.5 million acres \\nand destroyed or damaged over 30,000 structures. With climate \\nchange, we know that we can't just prepare for a fire season, \\nbut must now deal with this threat year round.\\n    And we know that wildfire risk will likely only continue to \\nincrease with the U.N. Environment Programme recently finding \\nthat the likelihood of extreme wildfires is expected to \\nincrease by up to 14 percent by 2030 and up to 50 percent by \\n2100 as a result of climate change and changes in land use.\\n    Mr. O'Mara, thanks for your testimony. You highlighted how \\nnatural solutions can minimize the impacts and severity of \\nwildfires, and you noted how, due to ever-increasing wildfire \\nrisk, Federal land management agencies, such as the U.S. Forest \\nService, have had to spend significantly larger portions of \\ntheir budgets on fire suppression, limiting their ability to \\nfund restoration and management activities to improve ecosystem \\nhealth and resilience.\\n    This hearing, I hope, is making it abundantly clear that an \\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\\n    Mr. O'Mara, can you share why the significant investments \\nin the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, specifically for wildfire \\nrisk reduction, are so important in reducing long-term wildfire \\nrisk?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Yeah. Thank you for that question, and thanks \\nfor your incredible leadership on this difficult issue.\\n    As you said, I mean, healthy forests, making sure that you \\nhave ecologically appropriate reforestation practices, making \\nsure you are removing invasives, making sure you are trying to \\nget at things like disease, or trying to make sure that you \\nhave--moving, in some cases, small-diameter trees and some of \\nthe tinder that leads to these massive fires, is all part of \\nhaving systems that are much more resilient to the kind of fire \\nspread that we have seen.\\n    I think a lot of folks talk about the acreage of the fires. \\nIt is the intensity, too. It is the level of heat. There is not \\nenough soil moisture in some of these cases. So all of a sudden \\nfires that may have had a couple--tens of thousands of acres \\nall of a sudden are in the hundreds of thousands of acres or \\nmillions of acres because these systems are not sufficiently \\nresourced.\\n    And, like, for most of the last decade, the Forest Service \\nis spending more than 60 percent of the budget fighting fires, \\nnot actually restoring forests. The bipartisan infrastructure \\npackage is going to help reverse that. The 27 billion that is \\nproposed in the reconciliation package would very much fix \\nthat, so hopefully that can be part of the ongoing \\nnegotiations.\\n    Mr. Levin. Exactly. Well, you pointed out that 27.5 billion \\nfor forest restoration that was included in the House-passed \\nreconciliation bill, that would be transformational for the \\nWest. And I think we will all continue to fight for a strong \\nreconciliation package, and specifically for that funding.\\n    Shifting gears, I wanted to speak about another challenge \\nwe are facing in southern California. That is water scarcity. \\nWe know that droughts, wildfires, rising temperatures, and the \\ndegradation of natural ecosystems are exacerbating this water \\ncrisis that we are facing.\\n    Can you expand on how protecting natural ecosystems on a \\nwatershed-wide scale can protect access to reliable clean \\nwater, and also how restoration projects in upper watersheds \\nbenefit users downstream?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Yeah. I mean, having healthy ecosystems, \\nwhether that is healthy forests or healthy grasslands, do \\nprovide an absorption value to keep kind of water where you \\nneed it and not having the high rates of evaporation that we \\nare seeing in southern California, for example, some of the \\nchallenges we are facing in the Sacramento Delta up north, and \\nreally kind of making sure you are kind of holding the water \\nwhere you need it so you have the access to it as the demand in \\nthe right places.\\n    And so, again, I mean, folks don't always think about \\nforests as not just a carbon sink, but kind of a water sink, as \\na way to have these healthy watersheds, but it is a critical \\npart of the solution. And I would much rather see that than \\nsome of the manmade conveyances that aren't nearly as effective \\nas what Mother Nature created.\\n    Mr. Levin. Thank you for that.\\n    Dr. Eisenberg, I would like to turn to you, staying on the \\ntopic of water, I was excited to hear about your work with \\nTribal communities in Montana restoring degraded lands with \\nnative plants, and was glad to hear about the positive \\necosystem health benefits you have seen through these \\nrestoration partnerships with Tribal communities.\\n    Can you discuss how these restoration practices can improve \\nwater resilience on an ecosystem-wide scale? And, also, how can \\nrestoring grasslands be a key natural solution to the West's \\nwater scarcity challenges?\\n    Dr. Eisenberg. Well, this has to do with fire and soil. So \\nfire is part of traditional practices done by Native people in \\nforests and grasslands throughout the United States for \\nmillennia. And what this does is it puts more carbon into the \\nsoil and in the prairie rangelands. And what that does is it \\ngreatly increases, has the potential to greatly increase the \\ncapacity of the soils to store water.\\n    Prairie soils, there are roots that go down up to three \\nmeters from these prairie grasses. And so the combination--\\nNative people used fire to create the sort of resiliency that \\nyou have been expressing concern about and to help retain \\nmoisture in both forest and grassland ecosystems. So fire is a \\ncritical piece of it.\\n    And so the restoration programs that we are working on, \\nright now we have a proposal to the BLM for a large program in \\nOregon, in the forests of Oregon, in the dry forests, to look \\nat these things. So it is not just about grasslands.\\n    Thank you.\\n    Mr. Levin. Thank you, Dr. Eisenberg.\\n    I am out of time, but I look forward to working with you \\nand all of our witnesses and hopefully across the aisle on this \\nvery important issue.\\n    And I will yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Rep. Levin.\\n    Next up is Rep. Crenshaw.\\n    You are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Madam Chair, thank you to the \\nRanking Member for holding this hearing, and thank you to the \\nwitnesses for being here.\\n    I absolutely think the work of conservation efforts and \\nforest management and protection of our natural resources is \\nextremely important, and I am sure the work done by many of our \\nwitnesses has contributed positively to that effort.\\n    I do have some concerns, as you might imagine. I have \\nconcerns that many environmental groups do not understand that \\ncritical balance between energy development and \\nenvironmentalism. I fear that many do not understand that you \\ncan indeed do both. After all, it was natural gas fracking in \\nAmerica that led to historic reductions in CO<INF>2</INF> \\nemissions.\\n    And I don't think this is a goal of many environmental \\ngroups. Unintentionally, intentionally, whatever it may be, \\nthere has been a serious undermining of American energy \\ndevelopment in United States, which has geopolitical \\nimplications, as we are seeing now with Russia and Ukraine and \\nEurope's dependence on Russian oil and gas.\\n    So my questions are going to be for Mr. O'Mara.\\n    You stated in your 990 that you are currently supporting \\nlitigation against Enbridge Line 5, which, if successful, would \\nremove half a million barrels per day, causing yet another \\nserious supply shortage of petroleum products in an environment \\nwhere there is already extreme shortages, increasing gas prices \\nin an environment where gas prices are already very high.\\n    Are you using Federal grant money to do this for your \\nefforts, recognizing, given the context, that that money is \\nindeed fungible?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. No. No. We receive very little Federal money.\\n    Mr. Crenshaw. Okay. But money is fungible.\\n    So you are taking grant money, and just a quick count of \\nFederal grant money from the last few 990s is over $4 million.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. For projects on the ground.\\n    Mr. Crenshaw. But it is fungible.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. It is not.\\n    Mr. Crenshaw. Outside of grant money from the United States \\nGovernment, what other sources fund your organization?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. So we receive--we have 6 million members, so \\nfolks that are sending $15. We have Ranger Rick Magazine, which \\nfolks subscribe to. We have some foundations that support us.\\n    Mr. Crenshaw. What about Sea Change Foundation, how much \\nhave you received from Sea Change?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Nothing in years.\\n    Mr. Crenshaw. The number is in front of me. In the past, \\nyour organization has received $3.4 million in funding from Sea \\nChange.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Nothing in the last 6 years, though. I have \\nonly been CEO for the last 5 or 6 years. I think that was \\nbefore.\\n    Mr. Crenshaw. Okay. So it was before. So it has happened in \\nthe past. It is good to know.\\n    The reason I am concerned about this is because it is well \\ndocumented that Sea Change is, in part, funded by a Russian \\nshell company based in Bermuda called Klein Ltd. Vladimir Putin \\nfunnels money through Klein to organizations for obvious \\nreasons: to undermine American oil and gas and keep the world \\ndependent on Russian oil and gas.\\n    And I will submit these reports for the record.\\n    But you were never aware of this or aware of this \\norganization?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. No. And, Congressman, I mean, I think, if you \\ntalk to some of your colleagues, we are considered like one of \\nthe most moderate, pragmatic organizations, actually trying to \\nfind solutions for domestic production and conservation at the \\nsame time. So I am a little surprised by this line of \\nquestioning, frankly.\\n    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, it is because of these talking points \\nthat Russia puts out and that some of our environmental groups \\nput out that are anti-American energy, they tend to coincide, \\nthey tend to be the same. And it is concerning when you start \\nto follow the money.\\n    I appreciate the fact that it hasn't happened in 6 years. \\nThat is good news. But the talking points haven't changed and \\nthe efforts haven't changed.\\n    And here is another question. So if you get rid of this \\npipeline, you get rid of more American production, do you think \\nthat affects worldwide demand or worldwide emissions?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Well, I think--I mean, if you want to talk \\nabout Line 5 specifically, it is coming from Canada. It is \\ngoing across the Great Lakes. It is a 63-year-old pipe that is \\nunder both Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. If it ruptures, it \\nwill be a catastrophic impact that is greater--it is going to \\nmake the BP oil spill look like child's play.\\n    I do think that is different. I mean, there are other \\npipeline projects we have not opposed. I mean, we are not in \\nkind of the pipeline business generally.\\n    If the Great Lakes become contaminated, especially when \\nthere are other alternatives--there is the Sarna (ph) Line, \\nthere is the 17th Line, there is a bunch of other options in \\nthat region. Having the Great Lakes be contaminated on our \\nwatch would be one of the greatest environmental disasters in \\nour history.\\n    We are not in the middle of all these other pipeline fights \\nthat you hear from other different groups, but that is one \\nwhere it is the most important freshwater source of water in \\nthe world. And having that happen--and, frankly, Enbridge, \\ngiven their history of the Kalamazoo spill and others, I mean, \\nit is just one of those cases where we need a better solution, \\nbecause you have a pipe that was supposed to last for 50 years, \\nand we are at 60-something and counting.\\n    Mr. Crenshaw. Okay. Look, the reason I am concerned about \\nthis--I am not the only one who has ever brought this up, that \\nRussian propaganda has made its way into a lot of \\nenvironmentalist talking points. You have done a good job \\ndefending your organization today, and I appreciate that.\\n    But I am not the only one who has said this. Hillary \\nClinton has stated this is true. NATO's Secretary General has \\nstated this is true. Our ODNI has stated this is true. Our \\nNational Security Council members have come out and testified \\nfor this.\\n    So it is an important piece of the puzzle when we talk \\nabout American production and how to balance that with \\nenvironmentalism. Believe it or not, we are all on the same \\npage on a lot of these efforts to increase our conservation \\nefforts and protect the environment.\\n    But we also have to protect people's ability to make a life \\nfor themselves and bring themselves out of poverty. You can \\nonly do that through energy security and in an environment \\nwhere inflation isn't skyrocketing. And so some of these \\nefforts directly contribute to that and benefit Russia. And I \\nthink that is the broader point that I am making.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Well, I mean, Congressman, to that plan, I \\nmean, look, I would much rather have clean American energy \\ndisplacing Russian oil and gas. I would much rather have clean \\nsupplies. Let's make sure it is as clean as possible. Let's \\nmake sure the rhetoric is real.\\n    Mr. Crenshaw. Glad to hear that.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Let's use American energy and clean energy, \\n[inaudible] pumps, renewable energy. But let's export all of \\nour technologies to fight----\\n    Mr. Crenshaw. Fully agree. Forty-one percent higher \\nemissions if you use Russian gas over American gas. So thank \\nyou. I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Gentleman from Texas yields back.\\n    Next, we will go to Rep. Brownley.\\n    You are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Ms. Brownley. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for holding \\nthis hearing. And I thank the witnesses today.\\n    I can't help but to take the opportunity to brag about a \\nproject in the district that I will soon represent, after the \\n2022 election. It is a project in a little town called Agoura \\nHills between the Simi Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains. \\nAnd, on Earth Day of this month, April 22nd, there will be a \\ngroundbreaking in terms of building a bridge over the 101 \\nFreeway.\\n    It is a bridge that is billed as the world's largest \\nwildlife crossing. It is a bridge that will be the first of its \\nkind near a major metropolitan area. And, as I mentioned, the \\nlargest in the world, stretching over ten highway lanes on a \\nvery, very, very, very, very busy freeway.\\n    And so, Mr. O'Mara, I know that the National Wildlife \\nFederation has been involved in this project. It is a very, \\nvery exciting thing that is happening in my area of the Conejo \\nValley, the Santa Monica Mountains, the Simi Hills.\\n    The partnership on this project is really inspiring. I \\nthink it is extraordinary. It is a partnership with the Santa \\nMonica Mountains Conservancy, the California Department of \\nTransportation--as we call it, Caltrans, in California--the \\nMountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, the National \\nPark Service, and the National Wildlife Federation.\\n    So, Mr. O'Mara, I just wanted you to comment on this \\nproject. I wanted you to talk a little bit about the benefits \\nof this project. And, if you could, talk a little bit about how \\nthis whole public-private partnership came to be.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Thank you so much for the questioning. And we \\nare looking forward to seeing you on Earth Day. It is going to \\nbe a great event out there in just a few weeks.\\n    So this is a great project. It will be the largest wildlife \\ncrossing in the world. The mountain lion population of southern \\nCalifornia across the Agoura Hills and into San Gabriel, kind \\nof thinking like the 101 and 5, has been completely bisected by \\nmassive highways.\\n    And so this is the project to try to reconnect some of that \\nhabitat in a very smart ecological way. It was started by some \\namazing research by the National Park Service that was looking \\nat fatalities of these amazing mountain lions that were dying \\nas they were trying to get across the 101 as a way to find \\nmates and find food.\\n    And so Beth Pratt, who I am sure you know, Congresswoman, \\nhas been a dynamo on this project, pulling together all the \\npartners. Amazing leaders, like philanthropists like Wallis \\nAnnenberg, and the Governor, as well as so many other partners \\nthat you mentioned.\\n    But this is a project, and I think, if we can show that we \\ncan go across a ten-lane highway in California, we should be \\nable to have wildlife crossings and connectivity all across the \\ncountry.\\n    And we were grateful for your leadership and others on this \\ncommittee for making that crossings program part of the \\ninfrastructure package. There is about $50 million a year to do \\nthese kind of projects.\\n    And the interesting thing, too, is that the insurance \\ncompanies love it because one of the biggest sources of payouts \\nare wildlife collisions. And so it is a way to actually reduce \\nvehicle accidents and make streets--make roads a little safer \\nand help wildlife at the same time.\\n    Ms. Brownley. Thank you so much for that.\\n    And, just with another minute or so left, in your \\ntestimony, you talked about nature solutions only being about 5 \\npercent of climate spending altogether. So that sort of makes \\nme--I think this might go back to somewhat of what the chair of \\nthe committee was asking originally in her questions.\\n    But if it is only 5 percent of the climate spending, are we \\nreally--and I think this hearing is really about an ounce of \\nprevention is worth a pound of a cure. The benefits are so \\ngreat. Are we really prioritizing correctly, I guess is the \\nquestion, in terms how we are spending dollars to mitigate \\nclimate?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Yeah. No, I appreciate the question. And, I \\nmean, of course I want to see more investment on the natural \\nclimate solutions. I think it is bipartisan. I think it is \\nincredibly smart, both for resilience and for carbon abatement. \\nAnd, at the same time, we also need the technological \\nsolutions.\\n    So I don't want to position it as an either/or. I think we \\nhave been a little light on that side. But as we are \\nelectrifying the grid and thinking about transportation and all \\nthe other investments on the climate side, I just want to make \\nsure that something that could be a quarter of the solution \\nisn't left so far behind, especially when it can be so \\nbipartisan in this current environment.\\n    Ms. Brownley. Thank you so much.\\n    Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you.\\n    Next up, Rep. Palmer, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Madam Chairman.\\n    I want to go back to a question that my colleague, Mr. \\nCrenshaw, asked about your funding. You did receive $2.1 \\nmillion from the MacArthur Foundation between 1991 and 2021 \\nthat would fall under the time frame for climate solutions and \\nenvironmental work. Is that correct?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. The MacArthur Foundation?\\n    Mr. Palmer. Yes.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Yes. I think we received maybe half a million \\ndollars last year.\\n    Mr. Palmer. How about the Hewlett?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Yeah.\\n    Mr. Palmer. Okay. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Loris, there was a report from the Little Hoover \\nCommission entitled ``Fire on the Mountain: Rethinking Forest \\nManagement in the Sierra Nevada'' that was the topic of a San \\nFrancisco Chronicle article. And the lede of the article said, \\n``A century of mismanaging Sierra Nevada forests has brought an \\nunprecedented environmental catastrophe that impacts all \\nCalifornians.''\\n    The Commission goes on to say, ``Plans for prescribed \\nburning to rid the forests of dense ground cover often clash \\nwith regional air quality regulations, even as emissions from \\ncatastrophic wildfires nullify hard-fought carbon reduction \\naccomplishments.''\\n    I just want to know your opinion in regard to the misguided \\nideas about prescribed burns which have led to unhealthy \\nforests, more carbon emissions, and unnecessary wildfire damage \\nand deaths, and particularly the intense heat that is created \\nby wildfires because of the failure to properly manage the \\nforests.\\n    Would you comment on that?\\n    Mr. Loris. Yeah. And Collin was exactly right when he said \\nit is not just about the size of these wildfires, it is also \\nabout the intensity and the heat.\\n    And prescribed burns and controlled burns is something that \\nthe U.S. has been doing for a long time. And, unfortunately, in \\nplaces where there has been more bureaucratic hurdles, it has \\nbeen happening less frequently than it otherwise should.\\n    I mean, you could look at a place like Florida juxtaposed \\nto California, and the rate of controlled burns in a place like \\nFlorida is so much more efficient than what happens in \\nCalifornia.\\n    And so I think this is something that has been time and \\nproven again where forest managers at the Federal level, at \\nState level, nonprofits, private organizations, private \\nlandowners, all understand the environmental importance of \\ncontrolled burns. And when an overly bureaucratic environmental \\nreview process happens, when these projects are held up in \\nyears of litigation, we see what happens.\\n    Mr. Palmer. Okay. I also have an article from Mother Jones \\nNews. It is a favorite publication of leftists. And it is about \\nthe pine beetles that are ravaging western forests. It has been \\nan issue in southern forests for decades, for years, as long as \\nI can remember.\\n    And in the article--I will read what it says. They are \\noften described as pesky invaders, bark beetles have been a key \\npart of conifer ecosystems for ages, ensuring that the groves \\ndon't get overcrowded.\\n    Is this a leftist--I don't even know how to describe this. \\nIs this some idea of how to log forests through beetles, to \\nmanage forests? I mean, to allow pine beetles to continue to \\ndecimate these forests and actually create even more fuel for \\nforest fires?\\n    Mr. Loris. Not to my knowledge. And, again, preventing and \\neradicating invasive species should be a bipartisan issue, and \\nI think there are a lot of pragmatic groups who believe that to \\nbe so. And the infrastructure bill provides $100 billion each \\nto the Department of Agriculture and Department of Interior.\\n    Again, I think the more we can get people on the ground \\ndoing the work to eradicate the invasive species, and the more \\nwe can provide and harness collaborative relationships between \\nprivate landowners, Federal and state agencies, and the Federal \\nagency, the better off we are going to be.\\n    Mr. Palmer. Okay. Let me move on to that.\\n    One of the ways to prevent this destruction of the forests \\nis to log these forests. And that is a way of sequestering \\ncarbon. When you cut the timber and you turn it into wood \\nproducts, you sequester carbon. But that is also a way to \\nmitigate the infestation of the pine beetles. You can cut the \\ninfested trees, peel off the bark, and burn them, which that \\ncreates some emissions issues, or cut the trees and then spray \\nwith toxic sprays.\\n    Doesn't it make more sense to engage in sensible logging \\npractices and forest management than to allow the pine beetles \\nto continue to destroy the forests and, again, create this \\nmassive amount of deadwood fuel that create these intensely hot \\nfires?\\n    Mr. Loris. Yeah. And part of that speaks to permitting and, \\nagain, environmental review challenges. I don't mean to sound \\nlike a broken record. You could lift the export ban on \\nunprocessed timber on Federal lands.\\n    You know, I mentioned the ARC legislation, the America's \\nRevegetation and Carbon Sequestration Act, that would allow for \\nsome of this development to occur and, again, for more mass \\ntimber development. And, again, I think we need to look at the \\ntradeoffs.\\n    When you use more timber, when you promote healthier \\nforests, rather than using concrete and rather than losing \\nthese forests to extremely intense and large wildfires, the \\nbetter off we are going to be from an economic standpoint, but \\nalso from a pollution and a greenhouse gas emissions \\nstandpoint.\\n    Mr. Palmer. My time has expired. I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Next up, Rep. Casten.\\n    You are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Casten. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    I want to talk about natural solutions as the theme of \\nthis, but I do just want to start, I feel compelled to respond \\nto some of the comments that have been made.\\n    Tomorrow will be the 2-year anniversary of President Trump \\ncalling the Saudi Arabian Government and saying that we are \\ngoing to withhold, we are going to take our troops out, unless \\nyou cut OPEC production, and in his words, because of a strong \\ndesire to protect the U.S. oil industry.\\n    I am delighted that in the 2 years since my colleagues \\nacross the aisle are now opposed to Vladimir Putin. I am \\ndelighted that my colleagues across the aisle now support \\nproviding defensive weapons to Ukraine. That is a genuine \\ntransition. It is welcome, overdue, and I think it is genuine.\\n    I am also extremely disappointed that they continue to \\noppose every policy that would reduce fossil fuel demand while \\nsimultaneously opposing anything that would increase fossil \\nfuel supply, as the ranking member did today in his opening \\nstatement. You cannot oppose demand reduction and oppose supply \\nreduction and claim to be in support of lowering fossil fuel \\ncosts.\\n    I get that that provides a lot of money to the fossil fuel \\nindustry. I get the fossil fuel would like to charge more for \\ntheir product. Please do not represent that ever again as being \\nin the interest of consumers.\\n    I am sure you will have some responses.\\n    Let me now move to--I want to thank Mr. Carter for his \\ncomments on trees, and I think that the benefits of trees \\nsequestering carbon are welcome.\\n    Urban trees are a really interesting thing. And the Morton \\nArboretum does some fascinating work in Chicago showing that \\nurban areas with trees, because of evapotranspiration, because \\nof shade, are five to ten degrees cooler, less load on the air \\nconditioning.\\n    It was my pleasure to provide them with $750,000 to help \\nfurther their research, because these trees are actually \\nincreasingly unable to survive in urban environments because of \\nwarming and pollution.\\n    And, Mr. O'Mara, I am wondering if you have any thoughts on \\nwhat we can do federally to enhance our urban tree canopy and \\nhelp the viability of those forests?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Thanks so much, and thanks for your leadership \\non this.\\n    I think it is a huge opportunity. And it is not just the \\nurban heat island effect. It is also the health benefits. I \\nmean, folks that have healthy tree canopies have lower rates of \\nasthma. You see less upper respiratory illnesses. I mean, the \\npublic health benefits are massive.\\n    Some of the best work in the country is actually being done \\nin Louisville, Kentucky, where they are actually doing a lot of \\nwork--it has been fairly segregated, the wealthier areas had a \\nlot of trees, other areas didn't--and looking at, like, the \\nbenefits.\\n    On the policy side, I think making sure that, like, urban \\ntree canopies are just an eligible use for a lot of these \\nprograms. A lot of times they are an afterthought, because you \\nthink of private lands or State lands or Federal lands.\\n    I think there is an issue with, like, technical assistance, \\nmaking sure there is enough capacity to actually do the care \\nand feeding, and making sure the trees survive, because, as you \\nsaid, warmer temperatures are leading to higher death rates of \\ntrees in different communities.\\n    But I think there are big opportunities to do some existing \\npots as well as some things we could kind of tuck into other \\nauthorizations.\\n    Mr. Casten. I would love to work on that.\\n    Moving from the urban to the much broader, I have seen \\nestimates that getting back to the agricultural--the soil \\ncarbon contents that we had a hundred years ago--I have seen as \\nmuch as 30 to 80 parts per million that we could pull out of \\nthe atmosphere if we could bring that back. Now, some of that \\nis easier said than done.\\n    But there is a really interesting program that Illinois has \\nrolled out to enhance the use of cover crops and couple that to \\nreductions in crop insurance for farmers, to sort of use \\ncurrency that the farmer understands, but add cover crops that \\nnot only increase soil carbon retention, but increase topsoil \\nretention, a whole host of other--I see you are nodding your \\nheads.\\n    We are working on trying to find ways to sort of federalize \\nthat really good state policy. And I am wondering if you have \\nany comments on what we might factor in as we think about \\nmaximizing the use of cover crops, not just in terms of the \\nclimate benefits, but also doing it in ways that will resonate \\nwith the farmers who are going to deploy this and address any \\nconcerns that they might have.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Yeah. I mean, it is interesting. We are seeing \\nthe uptick of cover crops going up in many parts of the country \\nright now, and Illinois is a great example, some good work in \\nWisconsin as well.\\n    It is not for climate reasons. I mean, it is because it \\nreduces soil erosion. It improves productivity, because the \\nsoils are richer and they are more fertile. It also is a way to \\nreduce kind of flooding impacts and just make sure that topsoil \\nisn't kind of blowing off.\\n    And I also think that we should be compensating farmers for \\nsome of the carbon benefits as well if they are willing to do \\nit.\\n    And so, I mean, I would love to be in a world where farmers \\nare paid for the commodity, but also for some of the other \\nbenefits they are providing. And the incentive of crop \\ninsurance is a perfect one, where all of a sudden we know we \\nare going to have to pay out less. If the soils are healthier \\nand there is less erosion, you are going to have less damage \\nfrom the next catastrophic storm.\\n    So I think getting those incentives right but not making it \\na climate program, there is a climate co-benefit, which is \\ngreat, but let's do it because it improves the economics, \\nimproves the soil health.\\n    Mr. Casten. Okay. And I know we are about out of time, but \\nif you have further comments for the record, one of the things \\nthat we have been struggling with is different regions of the \\ncountry, depending on the planting season and when the cover \\ncrop goes in, farmers think about it in different ways.\\n    And trying to find a way to do this not with a one size \\nfits all, but something that works for the different kinds of \\nagricultural environments in the country.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Yeah. And there is some great thinking going on \\nright now actually at the University of Illinois, Champaign \\naround making sure that some of the cover crops have markets \\nand not thinking of them just as like a byproduct, but actually \\nas another economic driver. So I would love to work with you on \\nthat.\\n    Mr. Casten. Thanks so much. Yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Next up, Ranking Member Graves.\\n    You are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Graves. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    It is not often that I have a chance to speak after Mr. \\nCasten, so I am going to go ahead and enjoy this for just a \\nminute.\\n    Look, we can sit here all day long, and I would be happy to \\nstay here as long as you want and go through all the facts. The \\nfacts are that under the Biden administration we saw a 161 \\npercent increase in dependence upon Russian crude oil, number \\none, period. That is a fact.\\n    Number two, you and your colleagues not only have opposed \\ndomestic energy production, just as this administration is \\ndoing--and I am going to quote this President when he said, \\n``We are going to ban all oil and gas.'' I am going to quote \\nhis Interior Secretary when I say that she said, ``We are going \\nto ban drilling on public lands and fracking everywhere.''\\n    I am going to talk about the SEC ESG initiatives. I am \\ngoing to talk about the executive order that said we are not \\ngoing to do any new production on Federal lands.\\n    And then talk about how we are going to go out there and we \\nare going to use renewables, but then stop the Twin Metals mine \\nand other efforts to actually produce critical minerals in the \\nUnited States that are required for renewable energy. Your \\nenergy policy is none of the above, not all of the above.\\n    Every single thing that we are experiencing right now is a \\nresult of the failed or just say the lack of an energy strategy \\nby this administration. And I hate to say this, Mr. Casten, but \\nyou and your colleagues have been complicit in this.\\n    We have offered amendments. I have offered amendments over \\nand over again to ban Russian oil, to prohibit it, and you know \\nwho has voted against it? That side of the aisle.\\n    You all want to have this discussion? I will have this \\ndiscussion all day long. Let me say it again. The President \\nyesterday said a million barrels of oil, a million barrels of \\noil a day. You know how much he was importing from Russia? Two \\nhundred thousand barrels. That is five times the amount, five \\ntimes the amount every single day. You know why? Because it is \\nmitigating for stupid energy strategies.\\n    I am all for all of the above. I will sit down with any of \\nyou all and talk through it. No policy and objecting to \\neverything is not a strategy, and the American people that we \\nall represent are paying for it right now, and it is \\nridiculous.\\n    I want to thank you all for being here.\\n    I want to say, Mr. O'Mara--I have got to tell you, I have \\nworked with him for a while when he was in Delaware, and I have \\nfound him to be an honest man, and I have found him to be a \\ngood partner to work with, although I do want to say, to \\nprotect your reputation, we don't always agree.\\n    Mr. O'Mara, I want to make sure I understand something that \\nyou said, and just give me a yes or no. You said in your \\nextensive testimony a lot of things, but one of them is that \\nyou believe that sequestration is a part of a--should be part \\nof a net zero strategy. Is that right?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Absolutely.\\n    Mr. Graves. Okay. Thank you. And you advocate for natural \\nsolutions, such as trees and other natural uptake. Something I \\nthink you and I have worked on in the past is engineered oyster \\nreefs, living shorelines, and things like that as a way to kind \\nof get your win-win-win-win-win scenarios. That is accurate?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Absolutely.\\n    Mr. Graves. Okay.\\n    So 45Q, which is enacted, is that an okay policy?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Absolutely.\\n    Mr. Graves. But we need to make improvements?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. But let's--and I think let's make it inclusive. \\nLet's include----\\n    Mr. Graves. Right. So you believe that 45Q is good, but \\nthat we should expand its scope to include natural or biogenic \\nsources?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Exactly.\\n    Mr. Graves. Okay.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. And it is cheaper. It is a lot cheaper.\\n    Mr. Graves. Which I totally agree with you. Totally on \\nboard. And I think that that does make sense.\\n    And then, lastly, in regard to efforts to restore coastal \\necosystems or wetlands or help to prevent the loss of those, \\nyou agree that that--both of those are strategies to either \\nsequester or to prevent the release of greenhouse gas?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Absolutely.\\n    Mr. Graves. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\\n    Mr. Loris, Ezra Klein did an op-ed in The New York Times a \\nwhile back, and he was talking about how NEPA, National \\nEnvironmental Policy Act, while well-intentioned perhaps, over \\nthe years and much case law that has, in my opinion, very much \\ndeviated from the actual focus or purpose of NEPA, that it has \\nactually contributed to the impediments, I guess, in terms of \\nour efforts to try to carry out projects such as renewable \\nenergy projects.\\n    Do you care to respond or comment on that?\\n    Mr. Loris. Yeah. I think you are seeing a movement from a \\nlot of folks kind of on the center-left aisle who are \\nrecognizing that some of the biggest impediments to clean \\nenergy infrastructure, to natural climate solutions is onerous \\nand bureaucratic environmental reviews and litigious \\norganizations who prevent these projects from happening in a \\ntimely manner.\\n    Ezra Klein did it. Matt Yglesias, another center-left \\neconomist, talked about the importance of cost reduction, but \\nalso of deployment. And you can't deploy technologies, you \\ncan't deploy transmission lines, you can't deploy new nuclear \\npower plants, you can't deploy natural climate solutions \\nwithout efficient environmental reviews and permitting.\\n    And so I think if you are talking about a silver bullet, \\nthis is certainly not it. There is a lot of things we need to \\ndo for American leadership and for global decarbonization.\\n    But in terms of helping with all of these solutions to \\ndecarbonize the energy sector, the manufacturing sector, and \\nthe agriculture and environmental sector for more carbon \\nuptake, this is something that can really accomplish all of \\nthose things.\\n    Mr. Graves. Thank you, Mr. Loris.\\n    I am out of time. But, Madam Chair, just one line. There is \\na quote from a 2016 private speech that Hillary Clinton gave \\nthat says, quote, ``We were even up against phony environmental \\ngroups, and I am a big environmentalist, but these were funded \\nby the Russians.''\\n    Yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Okay.\\n    Next up, we will go to Representative Huffman.\\n    You are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Huffman. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    You know, I thought we started off on a fairly hopeful note \\nin terms of finding one of those rare issues in the climate \\nconversation where we could have common ground and try to solve \\nproblems. And, unfortunately, some of the recent comments have \\ntaken us pretty deep down the rabbit hole.\\n    A few moments ago, I actually thought we were going to hear \\nthat Bill Gates was implanting microchips into pine beetles. \\nAnd then, more recently, we hear this preposterous narrative \\nthat major national environmental groups are somehow under the \\ninfluence of Vladimir Putin, as if he wants clean energy, the \\none thing that would render him powerless and irrelevant on the \\nworld stage.\\n    Look, the truth is there is a glass house problem when our \\ncolleagues across the aisle start suggesting that environmental \\ngroups are parroting Putin talking points. It is the fossil \\nfuel industry that for decades has had a very lucrative \\nbromance with Vladimir Putin. It was the Trump administration \\nfor 4 years that had the greatest collection of Putin fanboys \\noutside of the Kremlin anyone has ever seen, and our colleagues \\nthought that was just wonderful. It was making America great \\nagain.\\n    Look, we should not be looking to the fossil fuel industry \\nthat has been writing their talking points on these subjects \\nfor solutions to this mess. We should be sending them the bill \\nfor the war in Ukraine, because the fossil fuel industry has \\nalways been interested and today is still interested in only \\none thing, and that is keeping as many people as possible \\nhooked on their fossil fuel so that they can keep making lots \\nand lots of money. It is not very complicated.\\n    And maybe I should put it in terms that my colleagues could \\nunderstand in light of last week's revelations. If you have got \\na colleague that is doing key bumps of cocaine, whatever that \\nis, and you tell them, ``Gee, that is really bad for you, that \\nis hurting you, let me hook you up with this other dealer who \\nhas got better stuff,'' that is not a very good answer to the \\nproblem.\\n    And replacing dirty Putin natural gas with more dirty \\nnatural gas is not an answer to the energy crisis, the climate \\ncrisis, or the fact that we continue to experience fossil fuel-\\ndriven wars.\\n    So let's just get real about all of this stuff, and let's \\ntry to bring the conversation back to things that were actually \\nagendized where we might be able to find some solutions \\ntogether.\\n    Mr. O'Mara, restoring and better managing our U.S. lands \\nand waters can mitigate a fifth of our carbon emissions. We can \\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs. That is something we \\nought to be interested in talking about.\\n    Can you talk a little more about how natural solutions not \\nonly protect communities--and I represent a coastal community \\nlike Mr. Graves--but also increase the resiliency of ecosystems \\nin the face of our climate crisis?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Thank you for all the work that you have done.\\n    I think we are seeing both obviously huge sequestration \\nbenefits, but the ecological resilience of these systems, it is \\njust increasingly important. We are seeing, whether it is from \\na wildlife perspective, given the stressors that we are seeing \\non a whole range of species for communities that are adjacent, \\nwhether that is coastal communities that are suffering from \\nsome kind of coastal storm or a fire, and these healthy \\nsystems, that basically every dollar we have spent, whether it \\nis in your district or out east, in restoring these systems \\nreturns about $6 to $8 of avoided damage.\\n    And the places where we have invested have been able to \\ncome through these kind of horrific events much more whole than \\nother communities that haven't had those same benefits. And so \\nI think it really is just that win-win-win where it is safer, \\nhealthier, and better for the economy.\\n    Mr. Huffman. Terrific. And then we haven't heard from Mr. \\nWesterman yet, but he does have a bill with a wonderful title, \\nTrillion Trees Act. If good titles made a great bill, we would \\nbe off to the races with that legislation.\\n    And he and I have had lots of conversations about this, but \\nthe science is pretty clear that not all forests are alike, not \\nall treatments are the same in terms of their carbon \\nsequestration capacity.\\n    Could you talk about the importance of protecting old \\ngrowth trees? I don't know about Georgia and Mr. Carter's \\ntrees, but I know that, on the West Coast and in lots of places \\nin California, we have trees that can keep growing up to 800 \\nyears.\\n    And I think the science is fairly clear that it is that old \\ngrowth phenomenon that most powerfully sequesters carbon. So we \\nhave got to protect those things while we talk about other \\ntypes of forest management strategies.\\n    Please.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Yeah. No, absolutely. And I think some of the \\namazing sequoias and redwoods are spectacular from a carbon \\npoint of view.\\n    I think one of the cases we tried to make is that if we \\nwere actually compensating, whether it is landowners or others, \\nfor the carbon value, all of a sudden you change the incentives \\naround cutting earlier or, like, having these different \\neconomic drivers. Because I really don't want forest owners \\ngrowing houses either, right? I want them to stay in forests.\\n    But I do think some of the economic incentives, especially \\ngiven some of the trade policy issues the last several years, \\nhave been pushing folks to cut earlier, and so we are not \\ngetting the carbon benefits. We are also not getting the long-\\nterm benefits that you are talking about.\\n    And so the question is, how do you realign those \\nincentives? That is why I think that that 45Q idea is kind of \\ninteresting, because all of a sudden, if I know I am going to \\nmake more by allowing it to grow longer, because all of a \\nsudden those incentives start aligning, and you can have robust \\nmarkets at the same time.\\n    Mr. Huffman. Thanks, Madam Chair. I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you.\\n    Next up, Rep. Escobar.\\n    You are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Ms. Escobar. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    And many thanks to our panelists as well. Really appreciate \\nthe opportunity to talk about these issues.\\n    Frequently when we talk about protecting ecological \\ntreasures, we talk about the oceans, we talk about forests. We \\nrarely talk about the desert.\\n    I represent El Paso, Texas, a vibrant and safe, wonderful \\ncommunity on the U.S.-Mexico border that is in the Chihuahuan \\nDesert. And in my community, in the middle of it is the \\nFranklin Mountains. And, at the base of the Franklin Mountains \\nis this incredible treasure known as Castner Range.\\n    Castner Range is about 7,000 acres that belongs to the \\nFederal Government. And, for generations, for at least 50 \\nyears, El Pasoans have been trying to preserve Castner Range \\nand try to convince the Federal Government to preserve it for \\nopen space purposes.\\n    I have filed legislation to designate Castner Range a \\nnational monument in the hopes that it can at some point be \\nutilized for trails and for educational opportunities for young \\npeople, because there were many ancestors who came before us \\nwho lived on that land, lots of archeological treasure, and \\nalso lots of endangered species.\\n    The challenge for us is that it was an artillery range, and \\nso there is unexploded ordnance on the property. And so we have \\nbeen trying to collaborate with the Federal Government about \\nhow to approach it.\\n    But, in the meantime, the area around Castner, or at the \\nfoot of it on the other side of our freeway, there has been \\nlots of development. We know that there is always, especially \\nin urban areas, a desire to have the best view and to build as \\nmuch as possible on the side of the mountain, and El Paso is no \\ndifferent. Unfortunately, we have seen a lot of that happen.\\n    But one of the things I would actually like to ask you, Mr. \\nO'Mara and Dr. Eisenberg, about we were talking about damage \\ndone to our ecological treasures. Castner Range is also home to \\nlots of arroyos. And, for folks who don't know what an arroyo \\nis, it is a water channel basically. And, even though El Paso \\nis in the Chihuahuan Desert and we, unfortunately, have dealt \\nwith long-term drought, we also have monsoon seasons.\\n    And we have now seen hundred-year flooding. We have seen \\nunprecedented damage done to property and people, literally \\nhundreds of millions of damage. And with the ongoing drought, \\nthe soil just is not ready or equipped for rapid and large \\namounts of rainfall.\\n    So if both of you could speak to helping me get the Federal \\nGovernment to understand preserving open space in a desert \\nwhere there is drought and flooding, that it protects people \\nand property.\\n    Can you speak to the importance of that?\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Yeah. No, thank you, Congresswoman. And thanks \\nfor your work on that, and it was great to see the Secretary \\nthere the other day.\\n    I think there is a huge opportunity, and there is this \\nassumption that, because it is a desert environment, that it is \\nnot a living environment. And there are challenges with \\ninvasive species, there are challenges with restoring native \\nvegetation. There are issues in some cases in part of that \\nrange with, like, salt cedar and turmeric and some of the other \\ninvasive species that suck up so much water there isn't enough \\nfor kind of the native vegetation.\\n    And I think the conservation of the area is kind of the \\nstarting point. But, like, what we would like to work on with \\nyourself and others in the valley, kind of more broadly, is the \\nrestoration of these assets.\\n    I mean, I think when you look at the water levels in the \\nRio Grande, in particular, a little further south, the \\nchallenges that we have with not having enough water, with the \\nriver running dry, is because it is actually absorbing billions \\nof dollars, 25 billion gallons of water between the salt cedar.\\n    And there is a huge restoration opportunity there. It \\ndoesn't get the same kind of attention because folks don't \\nthink of it the same way. But I would love to work on it with \\nyou.\\n    Ms. Escobar. Thank you so much.\\n    Dr. Eisenberg, in the final 40 seconds of my time, would \\nyou like to add anything?\\n    Dr. Eisenberg. Yes. Ecocultural restoration is critically \\nimportant here, and restoration practices that take into \\nconsideration the processes of--the practices of the ancestors. \\nAnd, actually, that is the part of North America that my \\nancestors are from, northern Mexico.\\n    And so tapping into Tribal wisdom about this is essential, \\nand restoring those practices which addresses invasive species, \\nreintroducing fire if it was used regionally, which it probably \\nwas, and that then enables the soil to retain more moisture.\\n    Fire was used throughout the Southwest by Native people.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Dr. Eisenberg. I am sorry. We have a \\nvote, and we have another member.\\n    Thank you, Rep. Escobar.\\n    And next we will go to Mr. Westerman.\\n    Thank you for your interest in the Climate Crisis \\nCommittee. Welcome. You are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for \\nallowing me to join today. A lot to cover here, so I am going \\nto just jump right into it.\\n    I was pleased when I read the majority's memo on the \\nhearing, and especially the part where they reference climate \\nand ecological data. And just to be brief, I want to make sure \\nthat our witnesses are on the same page.\\n    As I read these bullet points, if you disagree with it, \\nplease raise your hand. If not, we will just go to the next \\none.\\n    The first point says: A 2020 report published in the \\njournal Nature found that if 15 percent of identified priority \\nareas are restored 60 percent of expected extinctions could be \\navoided and around 465 billion tons of CO<INF>2</INF> could be \\nsequestered, equal to 30 percent of the total amount of \\nCO<INF>2</INF> emitted in the atmosphere since the industrial \\nrevolution.\\n    Anybody disagree?\\n    A 2019 report published in the journal Environmental \\nScience and Technology found that restoring tree canopy cover \\ncan lead to a 27 percent further reduction in air pollution.\\n    Anybody disagree?\\n    A 2021 study in Environmental Research Letters found that \\nforests provide the highest quality water supplies among all \\nland uses and that more than 150 million Americans depend on \\nforested lands for their drinking water.\\n    Anybody disagree?\\n    A 2021 study published in the journals Frontier and Plant \\nScience found that the restoration of degraded grasslands from \\nsevere to moderate degradation stage improved grassland \\nvegetation by more than 38 percent and soil water storage by \\nalmost 42 percent.\\n    Anybody disagree?\\n    A 2021 study published in the journal Science found that 20 \\nyears after replanting tropical forests, numerous measures, \\nincluding soil fertility, carbon storage, and tree diversity, \\nreturned to nearly 80 percent of the levels of old growth \\nforest.\\n    Finally: A 2019 study published in the journal Science \\nfound that adding 2.2 billion acres of tree cover would capture \\n205 billion metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere, which is \\nequivalent to nearly two-thirds of the carbon emitted since the \\nindustrial revolution.\\n    Anybody disagree?\\n    I have read most of the reports that are behind these \\nstatements, and I agree. And that last one is actually the \\nbasis for the Trillion Trees Initiative, the global Trillion \\nTrees Initiative.\\n    Madam Chair, for the record, I would also like to submit \\nthis paper called ``Decarbonizing U.S. Buildings'' by the \\nCenter for Climate and Energy Solutions.\\n    And it has a statement: Residential and commercial \\nbuildings account for roughly 29 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas \\nemissions.\\n    Anybody disagree?\\n    Here is another one. It is a published journal article on \\nmass timber, global warming, carbon, and CLT. It is talking \\nabout using buildings to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\\n    And it says: ``The building sector is a major source of \\nglobal greenhouse gas emissions. Construction related \\nCO<INF>2</INF> emissions equal 5.7 billion tons, accounting for \\n23 percent of the emissions resulting from global economic \\nactivities.''\\n    It goes on to say: ``The building sector takes on even \\ngreater significance when considering the approaching wave of \\n2.3 billion new urban residents.''\\n    And it says energy-related CO<INF>2</INF> emissions from \\nbuildings is 39 percent globally.\\n    Anybody disagree?\\n    Next, do you support planting trees at home and abroad and \\nusing natural regeneration methods to increase forest cover so \\nthat we can grow more wood to store more carbon?\\n    Anybody disagree?\\n    Do you support management activities to make our existing \\nforests more resilient and healthy to grow more wood and store \\nmore carbon?\\n    Nobody disagrees.\\n    Do you support sustainable building practices to reduce \\ncarbon emissions during manufacturing and transporting building \\nmaterials, reducing carbon emissions from building operations, \\nand increasing the amount of carbon stored in the built \\nstructure?\\n    Everybody support that?\\n    Do you support using low-grade woody biomass material from \\nour forests to make renewable biofuel and biochar that could be \\nused as a soil additive for grasslands and agriculture that \\nincreases soil water efficiency and would be a long-term carbon \\nstorage solution?\\n    Everybody supports that.\\n    Madam Chair, it appears that there is unanimous, \\noverwhelming support from this panel for the Trillion Trees \\nAct, and this committee should fully embrace it, because that \\nis exactly what the Trillion Trees Act does.\\n    Next, I want to talk about giant sequoias. Mr. Huffman, I \\nthink, mentioned that.\\n    This chart shows fires in the giant sequoias. From 1898 to \\n2014, we averaged three fires per century. Previous to that, \\ngoing back centuries and centuries, we averaged 31 fires per \\ncentury, one every 3 years.\\n    Starting in 2015 to 2021, the number of fires and the \\nintensity of the fires has greatly increased. We lost 20 \\npercent of our giant sequoias to wildfires because of \\nmismanagement leading up to this time.\\n    Does the panel think we should save our giant sequoias?\\n    I agree, and there is a way to do it, and too bad we are \\nout of time or I would tell you.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Mr. Westerman.\\n    And next we will go to Rep. Neguse, who, unfortunately, is \\nall too familiar with wildfire destruction.\\n    Rep. Neguse, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Neguse. Well, thank you, Madam Chair, for your \\nleadership and for hosting this important hearing today.\\n    The timing of this hearing couldn't be better. Just \\nyesterday, my staff and I had the opportunity to visit with the \\nColorado Forest Restoration Institute, which is located at \\nColorado State University in my district, to learn more about \\nthe great work that they and the Southwest Ecological \\nRestoration Institutes are doing to restore our lands and our \\nforests, particularly after wildfires.\\n    For communities in my district, as you mentioned, Madam \\nChair, the threat of wildfires, of drought, and deteriorating \\nair quality is only worsening. Wildfire seasons are turning \\ninto wildfire years, with fires burning in August, in December, \\nand in March.\\n    In the last 18 months alone, the largest, second largest, \\nand most destructive fires in Colorado history all occurred in \\nmy district, with the devastating Marshall Fire in December \\ndestroying over a thousand homes. And just last weekend we had \\nanother wildfire, the NCAR Fire, in South Boulder.\\n    The cost of climate change for my community could not be \\nmore clear. We need bold, decisive action to address these \\nimpacts and to tackle these existential threats.\\n    Earlier this month, I was proud to join with my colleague, \\nRepresentative Matsui from California, to launch the Nature and \\nOceans Task Force of the House Sustainable Energy and \\nEnvironmental Coalition. Thank you to my select committee \\ncolleagues, Representative Huffman and Representative Bonamici, \\nfor joining us in this effort as members of the task force, and \\nI certainly look forward to the important work on those \\nmatters.\\n    It is time for Congress to take action to mitigate the \\nimpacts of these climate-fueled disasters, and I am so glad \\nthat we are holding this hearing today to explore some of the \\nways that we can use natural climate solutions to do just that.\\n    Mr. O'Mara, you used one of my favorite phrases in your \\nwritten testimony, that an ounce of prevention is worth more \\nthan a pound of cure. I have certainly found this to be true in \\nwildfire and forest restoration efforts and in preparing for \\nnatural disasters more broadly.\\n    I wonder if you might be able to share or perhaps expound \\nmore on some of the examples of the cost savings resulting from \\nforest restoration and ecosystem protection efforts and how \\nthose efforts strengthen our lands, our forests, and our oceans \\nagainst future natural disasters.\\n    Mr. O'Mara. Thank you, Congressman.\\n    And in the forest space, we see at least like a 3:1 cost \\nsavings. For every dollar we spend on forest restoration we can \\navoid $3 to $4 of damage. Some estimates are even much higher \\nthan that.\\n    And so we are incredibly bullish and grateful for your \\nleadership on the bipartisan infrastructure package, as well as \\nthe forestry package and reconciliation, to drive a lot of \\nthese investments.\\n    I think it is not a one size fits all. It has got to be \\necologically appropriate. It has got to be done in ways that \\nkind of work on the local landscape and work with the local \\ncommunities.\\n    But it is a huge cost savings. And it is much cheaper--as, \\nunfortunately, folks in Boulder have experienced repeatedly--to \\nhave healthier systems earlier as opposed to trying to pick up \\nthe pieces afterwards.\\n    So I just think, again, one of the things I would like to \\nwork with all of you on is actually scoring this appropriately, \\nbecause right now you have to figure out how to pay for that $1 \\nof prevention, where what we don't count for the supplemental \\nappropriation, you have to pay after the fact, when we could \\navoid a lot of that damage.\\n    So there has got to be a way to fix that with CBO because \\nthese are savings that are attributing--we are spending, I \\ndon't know, a hundred, two hundred billion dollars a year on \\nsupplemental appropriations. None of that is in the forward-\\nlooking debt projection. But it is definitely there, it is \\ndefinitely real. And we should be investing now because we know \\nwe can save those costs tomorrow.\\n    Mr. Neguse. I couldn't agree with you more. And I think the \\npoint that you raise is a salient one with respect to being \\ncognizant of finding ways to incorporate the costs on the back \\nend as we are making these considerations here in the Congress.\\n    The fact that it is a 1:3 cost savings is just--it is a \\nfact that I think we lose sight of here in Congress and that we \\nshouldn't. And certainly my community has not lost sight of \\nthat fact in light of the natural disasters that we have \\nexperienced in just the last 18 months.\\n    So I thank you for the testimony.\\n    I thank all of the witnesses for their testimony today.\\n    Cognizant perhaps of the votes that have been called, I \\nwill yield the balance of my time, but, again, will thank the \\nwitnesses and the chair for her leadership.\\n    And I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Rep. Neguse.\\n    And thank you to all of our witnesses for your very \\ninsightful testimony today.\\n    All members have 10 business days within which to submit \\nadditional written questions for the witnesses, without \\nobjection. And I will ask the witnesses to respond promptly.\\n    Mr. Westerman has asked for unanimous consent to submit \\ninto the record two reports, one entitled, ``Developments in \\nthe Built Environment,'' November 2020, and, ``Decarbonizing \\nU.S. Buildings,'' from Climate Innovation from July 2018.\\n    I believe Rep.

Ecosystem restoration and conservation are key tools in adapting \\nto and mitigating the risks from climate change, but we must ensure \\nthese types of projects are designed and implemented in a way that \\nsecures the needed results for climate, biodiversity, and communities. \\nWhat are the main challenges and lessons learned from engaging with \\ncommunities, especially underserved communities, when developing \\nprojects to respond to climate change?\\n\\n    There are several challenges and lessons that have been learned \\nfrom engaging with communities, especially underserved communities, in \\nadapting to and mitigating the risks from climate change. As a result, \\nand to be effective, projects need to consider the following:\\n\\n    1. Working with communities is labor intensive due to the need to \\ndevelop relationships and ascertain capacity, needs, and constraints. \\nThis creates a need for capacity building for engagement to get local \\nprojects approved and secure funding. Taking time to understand a \\ncommunity's issues and learning how to dialogue and discuss contentious \\nissues (both with disadvantages and advantaged sectors). Having \\ndedicated personnel to meaningfully engage over the long-term and \\ntranslate the science and advancements would catalyze mitigation \\nactions. This is especially important for climate initiatives to gain \\nstronger support.\\n\\n    2. Time horizons of projects needs to be long enough to develop \\nmeaningful partnerships. Community-based interventions/projects can \\noften be too small (2-5 years long) and sporadic (i.e., one-off \\nprojects) in an uncoordinated manner. Movement towards ``phased'' \\nprojects is a prudent strategy.\\n\\n    3. Interventions often do not take into consideration the cultural, \\npolitical, and economic conditions of local communities. Holistic \\napproaches are needed for identification and valuation of benefits in \\nterms of community health and well-being, carbon mitigation, green \\ninfrastructure, etc.\\n\\n    4. Critical examination of existing finance and funding mechanisms \\nis needed to understand who benefits (and who does not), how and why.\\n\\n    5. Racial zoning and redlining have creating pockets of \\ndisadvantage for some and prosperity for others. Planning and \\ndevelopment processes/policies/practices need to be linked to \\nenvironmental justice and social vulnerability to dismantle systemic \\ninequities and redistribute power and privilege.\\n\\n    6. There are often mismatches in locations where marine system \\nrestoration is permitted versus locations that actually need the \\necosystem service. While more relevant for nutrient storage and removal \\nas opposed to carbon, it is still important when thinking about value \\nto an individual community as opposed to worldwide value.\\n\\n    7. Climate resilience is about more than physical safety. Projects \\nshould ensure that they are looking at all adaptation measures within a \\nholistic vision of what is needed, wanted and how to get there. Then \\nthey can determine how NNBF's (Natural & Nature-Based Features) fit \\ninto adaptation plans.\\n\\nPublications\\n\\n    <bullet> https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s13280-022-01723-\\n1?sharing_token=Qbbs\\n      klk_AHjsOx2G0VYTAfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY5-7v4OXTL-91pP_yLEd9vxp9\\n      W23e9Cyb55Kir0ElbW1GZdRPek2yHux2-OQk3ATZ_f-hexVWQ4gBsCk1RoM2C\\n      qa9yUNZbnc4_4XzYB8X3YrAWKBxMIw7isY_xGSFlnLcQ%\\n  <bullet> https://cdn.sei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/spotlight-on-\\n        social-equity-finance-and-scale-nbs-2021.pdf\\n    <bullet> https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/\\nrstb.2019.0120\\n    <bullet> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/\\nS0301479720306812\\n    <bullet> https://www.nature.com/articles/s42949-022-00047-z\\n    <bullet> https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/env.2020.0054\\n\\nWebsites\\n\\n  <bullet> https://www.aaas.org/events/community-and-organization-\\n        panel-discussion-green-infrastructure\\n    <bullet> https://n-ewn.org\\n\\nRelated Sea Grant Projects\\n\\n    <bullet>  Southeast and Caribbean Climate Alliance, funded by \\nNOAA's Climate Program, Regional Integrated Science and Assessments \\n(RISA):\\n    https://gacoast.uga.edu/outreach/programs/coastal-hazards/\\n        southeast-caribbean-climate-alliance/\\n    <bullet>  PLACE:SLR (Program for Local Adaptation to Climate \\nEffects: Sea-Level Rise), a partnership between Sea Grant programs in \\nthe northern Gulf of Mexico has:\\n\\n      <bullet>  Provided several tools for climate mitigation at the \\nlocal level:\\n        www.GulfTREE.org, www.localslr.org, www.bit.ly/Future-Flooding\\n      <bullet>  Assembled best practices on stakeholder engagement and \\ntesting the findings:\\n        https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/training/underserved-\\ncommunities.html\\n      <bullet>  Described their experience in putting tools into \\npractice (video):\\n        https://youtu.be/V2-wJWSD9Rc\\n\\n    <bullet>  Climate Smart Floridians helps an individual identify \\nwhat they can do to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. \\nDemonstrating that there are small, actionable, steps, one can do to \\naddress climate change makes it seem more approachable, and could help \\novercome the general distrust of science (especially when it comes to \\nclimate change research).\\n\\n    2. Certain habitats, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands, \\ncan provide needed carbon sequestration. However, different habitats \\nprovide different benefits. What are the similarities and differences \\nbetween terrestrial and marine carbon sequestration? What additional \\nresearch on blue carbon is needed and why?\\n\\n    The quest for carbon storage strategies should be addressed through \\nboth terrestrial and marine projects because we are going to have to \\nfind and use every mechanism to have to sequester and store excess \\ncarbon. That said, finding the most efficient and least expensive ways \\nto sequester carbon over the long run is important. There are at least \\nthree contexts in which marine and terrestrial carbon storage differ:\\n    The first primary difference between marine and terrestrial carbon \\nstorage is that in marine systems, carbon is typically buried in the \\nsoil instead of in plant biomass (like forests), which makes marine \\ncarbon storage less susceptible to many hazards (e.g., forest fires). \\nWhile that is true, marine carbon storage remains susceptible to things \\nlike resuspension due to plant loss and hurricanes, and to the \\ndisruption of the sediment that might increase rates of decomposition. \\nThere is some debate on what happens if plants die; the living plants \\nwith a healthy root system keep the sediments in place so if they die, \\nthe long-term storage may be lost. Direct measurements of this loss \\nthough are rare and vary probably depend on the scale of the loss and \\non site-specific wave energy (see Aoki 2021 and references there in). \\nThe Fourqurean paper estimated carbon stocks for seagrasses and \\ndiscusses some of those differences. The classic paper is McLeod 2011.\\n    The second primary difference in marine and terrestrial carbon \\nstorage is that we have the ocean, which can absorb carbon. A \\nconsequence of this is acidification. Recent work suggests that coastal \\nblue carbon habitats might not be as efficient at carbon storage as \\noriginally thought because of dissolved inorganic carbon export (Santos \\net al. 2021).\\n    The third primary difference in marine and terrestrial carbon \\nstorage is with respect to shellfish where carbon is sequestered from \\nphotosynthesis, storage as biomass, and through calcification (shell \\ngrowth). Fodrie et al. 2017 found that reefs next to marshes were \\ncarbon sinks while reefs isolated on mudflats were carbon sources. It \\nis also important to remember that calcification produces \\nCO<INF>2</INF>. Grabowski et al. discusses the ecosystem services of \\noysters. But, the location of these habitats really matters, not only \\nfor carbon storage (Fodrie et al) but also nutrient removal (Smyth et \\nal.).\\n\\nResearch needs should seek to determine:\\n\\n     1.  the sources and magnitude of variability in estimates of \\ncarbon sequestration;\\n     2.  a common system of assessment and measurement in support of \\nthe development of payment systems and trading programs;\\n     3.  the importance of size and scope of restoration projects on \\nthe trajectory or timeline of carbon sequestration; better \\nunderstanding the role of alkalinity, organic and inorganic carbon and \\nthe carbon cycle in general in coastal systems;\\n     4.  interactions between multiple stressors like acidification and \\neutrophication;\\n     5.  drivers of greenhouse gas emissions and burial rates from \\ncoastal habitats to move beyond sequestration and look at the balance \\nbetween services and disservices;\\n     6.  the contribution of outwelling of dissolved carbon as well as \\ncarbon sequestration;\\n     7.  how blue carbon habitats in tropical and subtropical \\necosystems differ from other climates and land-based systems;\\n     8.  the extent of permanent carbon storage (net carbon balance) \\nfrom shell growth;\\n     9.  the role and importance of macroalgae as a carbon sink; and\\n    10.  what management approaches promote carbon sequestration.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n    Aoki: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/\\nfmars.2020.576784/full\\n    Bezerra: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo4578\\n    Dencer-Brown: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-022-\\n01723-1\\n    Fodrie et al: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/\\nrspb.2017.0891\\n    Fourqurean: https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1477\\n    Grabowski et al: https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/62/10/\\n900/238172\\n    McLeod: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/\\n10.1890/110004\\n    Needleman: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12237-018-\\n0429-0\\n    Oldfield: https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abl7991\\n    Santos et al:\\n      https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/\\nS0272771421002146#fig1\\n    Smyth et al:\\n      https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/\\n1365-2664.12435\\n    Van Dam et al: https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/\\nsciadv.abj1372\\n\\n                        Questions for the Record\\n\\n                         Dr. Cristina Eisenberg\\n\\n                 Courtesy Faculty, College of Forestry\\n\\n              Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society\\n\\n                        Oregon State University\\n\\n                       the honorable kathy castor\\n    1.

How can Congress ensure ecocultural restoration is \\nintegrated in Federal decision-making?\\n\\nDefinition of Ecocultural Restoration:\\n\\n    Ecological restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of \\nan ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed.\\\\1\\\\ \\nEcocultural restoration acknowledges and honors Indigenous peoples' \\ncontributions and traditional wisdom. Defined as the process of \\nrestoring key historic pre-contact, pre-industrial ecosystem \\nstructures, processes, and functions, and the Indigenous cultural \\npractices that helped shape ecosystems, ecocultural restoration (also \\nreferred to as biocultural restoration) increases resiliency to climate \\nchange and other stressors, while supporting Indigenous ecosystems and \\ntheir cultures.\\\\2\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Gann, et al. 2019.\\n    \\\\2\\\\ Kimmerer 2011; Zedler, and Stevens 2018; Martinez 2019; \\nDickson-Hoyle, et al. 2021.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Ecocultural restoration is based on Traditional Ecological \\nKnowledge (TEK; also known as Indigenous Traditional Knowledge--ITEK), \\ndefined as knowledge and practices passed from generation to generation \\ninformed by cultural memories, sensitivity to change, and values that \\ninclude reciprocity. TEK land-care practices include using prescribed \\nfire and seasonal flooding to modify vegetation, conserving culturally \\nsignificant species such as beaver (Castor canadensis) and bison (Bison \\nbison bison), or adjusting timber use to create more sustainable \\ncommunities of traditional plants that provide wildlife habitat, and in \\nturn, food for humans. These processes increase biodiversity and \\necological resilience by creating fine-grained, landscape mosaics that \\nfunction within an ecosystem's range of natural variability. Further, \\nTEK acknowledges that change is constant in an ecosystem. Because \\nIndigenous people see the world as always changing, their TEK is \\ndesigned to observe and acknowledge these changes, and act on them \\nrapidly by adjusting Indigenous land stewardship and subsistence \\npractices. In this manner, TEK can optimize climate resiliency, as a \\nform of adaptive management that has been use for millennia \\nglobally.\\\\3\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ Kimmerer 2000; Roos, et al. 2018; Eisenberg, et al. 2019; \\nReyes-Garcia et al. 2019.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nEcocultural Restoration and Cultural and Climate Resilience:\\n\\n    Established in 1888, the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation (FBIR) is \\nhomeland of the Nakoda (Assiniboine) and Aaniiihnen (Gros Ventre) \\nTribes. It lies in north-central Montana, north of the Missouri River, \\non the Northern Great Plains, comprising 263,000 ha. FBIR lands are \\nprimarily used for grazing, agriculture, ceremonies, hunting, gathering \\ntraditional plants for food and medicine, recreation, natural resource \\nextraction, and conservation. Adjacent Bureau of Land Management (BLM) \\nlands are used for grazing, natural resource extraction, hunting, \\nrecreation, and conservation.\\n    On the FBIR, the ecocultural restoration work we are doing will \\nhelp generate cultural and climate resilience for Fort Belknap Indian \\nCommunity (FBIC) and BLM. Specifically, in partnership with BLM, Oregon \\nState University (OSU), and Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), \\nwe are developing an ecocultural restoration plan based on FBIC TEK, \\nwith the guidance and participation of the Tribal Council, the Tribal \\nHistorical Preservation Office, Tribal elders, youth, natural resources \\nstaff, and educators, applicable to multiple-use FBIR and BLM lands in \\nthis region. Because the plan will be built on Indigenous stewardship \\npractices in this grassland used for millennia (e.g., prescribed \\nburning, conserving culturally significant plants that also function as \\nsoil-stabilizing plants and carbon sinks) that have always included \\nadaptation to changes in the climate, it will build climate resilience \\nand increase what today we refer to as the ecosystem services on which \\nhumans rely for survival, such as fertile soil, plants, pollination, \\nand clean water.\\\\4\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\4\\\\ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. \\n2021.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Additionally, because we are engaging the FBIC with jobs and \\ntraining for youth, including creating a Tribal youth conservation \\ncorps that provides income and natural resource training, and because \\nthe youth involved in this program will be the lead authors of the \\necocultural restoration plan we are developing, this work is also very \\ndirectly building capacity within FBIC. By engaging Tribal youth, we \\nare creating a STEM pathway for them in higher education at \\ninstitutions such as OSU, helping them develop into future leaders in \\nnatural resource management and conservation. Collectively this is \\ngenerating cultural resiliency--by empowering youth to use their \\nculturally traditional relationships with the natural world to find \\nnature-based climate solutions that are also firmly grounded in Western \\nscience. This strategy is called Two-Eyed Seeing. By combining the \\nempirical strengths and logic of Western science and the insights and \\nwisdom of TEK, one gains binocular vision that enables people to find \\nsolutions to challenging natural resource problems, such as global \\nwarming. The ecocultural restoration plan we are co-creating will be \\nbased on cultural competency (e.g., understanding the FBIC culture), \\nand will go beyond that to cultural humility (e.g., self-assessment and \\naccountability, openness, and equitable relationships with all \\ninvolved).\\\\5\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\5\\\\ Bartlett, et al. 2012.\\n\\nHow Congress Can Ensure Integration of Ecocultural Restoration into \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n        Federal Decision-Making:\\n\\n    According to the White House Office of Science and Technology \\nPolicy, TEK could and should improve understanding of climate change \\nand environmental sustainability. TEK also could help in the \\ndevelopment of comprehensive climate adaptation and natural resources \\nmanagement strategies, aimed at achieving mutually beneficial outcomes \\nfor Tribal Nations and U.S. Federal agencies.\\\\6\\\\ However, the U.S. \\nFederal government tends to implement top-down strategies using one-\\nsize-fits-all approaches. Such approaches will not be effective in \\nincorporating ecocultural restoration into Federal decision-making. \\nThis is because ecocultural restoration, which is informed by TEK, is \\nstrongly place-based, and comes from Indigenous cultures, with each \\nTribal Nation having a unique culture.\\\\7\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\6\\\\ White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ); 2021a. \\nWhite House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). 2021b.\\n    \\\\7\\\\ Reyes-Garcia 2019.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Co-management is a partnership whereby the government shares power \\nwith resource users, with clearly specified rights and responsibilities \\nfor each actor relating to management and decision-making. In the U.S., \\nFederal co-management efforts that incorporate ecocultural restoration \\nvia TEK and uphold treaty rights are one of the foundational principles \\nin addressing initiatives such as Presidential Executive Order 14008 on \\nClimate Change.\\n    With Tribal Nations, co-management typically includes a Memorandum \\nof Understanding (MOU). Such partnerships convey economic benefits to \\nTribes and government agencies, with mutual respect and reciprocity, \\nand can function as stepping-stones to self-determination. However, in \\npractice, co-management can be an imperfect alliance, because its roots \\nlie in settler colonialism.

In order for it to succeed in its application, it must be \\nplace-based and part of a partnership based on inclusive, equitable, \\nand respectful interactions. It must include relationship building that \\nleads to government-to-government policy actions that honor Tribal \\nsovereignty and self-determination rights, via formal agreements (e.g., \\nMOUs).\\\\8\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\8\\\\ Usher 200; Houde 2007; Nadasdy 2007; Nie 2008; Kenney 2012; \\nCasson 2015; Reid et al. 2018; Grey and Kuokkanen 2019.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Congress can ensure that ecocultural restoration is incorporated \\ninto Federal decision-making by implementing policies and providing \\nsecure, dedicated funding to enable development of the trust-based \\nrelationships described above.

In your testimony, you noted the differences you saw in the \\ncondition of the grasslands on Tribal lands as compared to the BLM \\nlands. Please describe what these differences indicate, and why healthy \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ngrasslands are so important.\\n\\nDifferences between FBIC Tribal lands and BLM lands:\\n\\n    Global warming is leading to increasingly frequent severe and \\nextensive drought and wildfires. Warmer temperatures, below-average \\nwinter precipitation, earlier snowmelt, and drier summers are creating \\nlonger wildfire seasons. Ecosystems managed for agriculture often lack \\nthe resiliency to recover from these disturbances and other \\nenvironmental stressors (e.g., insect outbreaks), because such \\nmanagement involves plowing the soil, planting non-native agronomic \\nspecies for harvest, and eliminating or disrupting processes with which \\nthese ecosystems co-evolved, such as intermittent intensive grazing by \\nherds of bison, low-severity fires set by Indigenous people, and mixed-\\nseverity wildfires.\\\\10\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\10\\\\ Bond, et al. 2004; Fuhlendorf, et al. 2008; Allred, et al. \\n2011; Grimm, et al. 2013; Polley, et al. 2013; Lark, et al. 2020; \\nHessburg, et al. 2021.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    We are working to address the above issues in our grassland \\nrestoration project, which began in 2019 in the Northern Great Plains \\nBiome of Montana, on BLM and FBIR lands. I am the Lead Principal \\nInvestigator (PI) of this project, and Dr. Thomas H. DeLuca is the co-\\nPI. In addition to the FBIC and BLM, project partners consist of OSU \\nand SER. Our grassland restoration project goals are to:\\n\\n      a)  Help the BLM Plant Conservation and Restoration Program \\n(PCRP) ensure a stable commercial supply of native plant materials for \\nrestoration and rehabilitation efforts on public lands.\\n      b)  Help BLM inventory and quantitatively assess the condition \\nand trend of natural resources on the nation's public lands.\\n\\n    We are meeting these goals by surveying U.S. Federal and adjacent \\nTribal lands using Assessment, Inventorying and Monitoring (AIM) \\nprotocols, and then applying BLM Seeds of Success (SOS) protocols to \\ncollect the seeds of target species for conservation. Target species \\ninclude those known to stabilize soils after a severe fire or other \\ndisturbance, such as Junegrass (Koelaria macrantha), which can rapidly \\nresprout and help prevent erosion. Seeds go to the National Seed \\nRepository to eventually be used for ecological restoration of public \\nlands that have been degraded by catastrophic fire, drought, or \\nintensive conventional agriculture.\\\\11\\\\ An additional goal is to co-\\ncreate an ecocultural restoration plan with the FBIC, based on TEK \\n(described in the response to Q1), to increase resiliency to drought \\nand other environmental stressors.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\11\\\\ BLM 2021a; BLM 2021b.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    During the summer of 2021, much of the Western U.S. experienced an \\nextreme drought. Per National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \\n(NOAA) and State of Montana data, our study site on the FBIR and \\nsurrounding BLM lands was in D3 (Extreme) and D4 (Exceptional) drought. \\nIn D3 conditions, crops are not harvestable, winter pasture is opened \\nfor grazing, the soil has large cracks in it, and the fields are bare. \\nCattle have very little water and producers must import water and \\nsupplemental feed. Fire restrictions increase. In D4 conditions, \\npasture loss is widespread, crops are destroyed, fire risk is extremely \\nhigh, and fires are widespread.\\\\12\\\\ Given that most of our study site \\n(both FBIC and BLM land) is used primarily for some form of \\nagriculture, and that for residents of north-central Montana, \\nagriculture is a leading occupation and income source, D3 and D4 \\ndrought can have devastating economic impacts on human communities in \\nthis region.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\12\\\\ NOAA, NRCS, State of Montana 2022.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    In June-August, 2021, when we surveyed FBIR and BLM lands, which \\nconsist of mixed-grass prairie communities, I received one of the most \\npowerful lessons of my career as an ecologist. In keeping with expected \\nD3-D4 drought conditions, our field crew and I found that in late \\nspring on BLM lands, which were dominated by exotic (e.g., non-native/\\ninvasive) grass species (primarily crested wheatgrass, Agropyron \\ncristatum), with some native grasses (Sandberg bluegrass, Poa secunda, \\nand Western wheatgrass, Pascopyrum smithii), these grasses grew \\napproximately six inches tall. On adjacent FBIC land that had the same \\ndrought conditions, climate, elevation, geomorphology, and other \\necological characteristics, but contained mostly native plant species \\n(primarily Western wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and green \\nneedlegrass, Nassella viridula), the same grasses grew up to four feet \\ntall. On BLM land, in the few places where native plants, such as \\nbluegrass, had bloomed, their seed pods were hollow, lacking a \\ncotyledon, because the plant had suppressed growth to survive. This \\nstark difference in plant drought resiliency was unattributable to \\ncattle; both Tribal and BLM lands are multiple-use lands, subject to \\ncattle grazing, which we documented with trail cameras. Further, \\nbecause of the drought response described above, on FBIR land we were \\nable to collect 23 pounds of seeds of target species for conservation. \\nOn neighboring BLM land we were only able to collect 3 ounces (0.19 \\npounds or 0.8%) of seeds of target species, despite scoping those \\nFederal lands really thoroughly for several weeks, working in Blaine \\nand Phillips Counties.\\n    Dr. DeLuca, an eminent soil scientist, and I hypothesize that this \\ndifference between FBIR and BLM land is at least partly related to \\ndifferences in soil ecology between the two systems. Charcoal (also \\nknown as pyrogenic carbon, PyC) legacies in the soil created by the \\nlow-severity fires historically set by Indigenous people were deposited \\nin mineral soils on a frequent and in some cases annual basis. The \\nrecalcitrant nature of PyC results in its accumulation over time, \\nthereby increasing the scale and function of the soil carbon pool, \\nresulting in increased nutrient availability and drought \\nresiliency.\\\\13\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\13\\\\ DeLuca et al., 2020.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Indigenous burning is a key TEK land stewardship practice used \\nglobally to improve soil health.\\\\14\\\\ In what is today the U.S., \\nIndigenous use of fire to improve habitat for wildlife and productivity \\nof culturally significant species of plants harvested as part of the \\nhunter-gatherer lifeway has been widely documented. On the Northern \\nGreat Plains, Indigenous people used fire to manage plant communities \\nto improve availability of culturally significant plants used for \\nmedicine and subsistence, such as Indian turnip (Pediomelum \\nesculentum), and improve bison habitat. These prescribed fires were \\ntypically of low severity.\\\\15\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\14\\\\ Bond, et al. 2005; Kimmerer, and Lake 2001.\\n    \\\\15\\\\ Boyd 2022; Lake, et al. 2017; Roos, et al. 2018.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    In the 1800s, when Tribal lands were stolen and settled by Euro-\\nAmericans throughout the U.S., fires were suppressed. As part of \\ncolonization, the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 placed Native \\nAmericans on Indian Reservations and ended Tribal sovereignty \\nrights.\\\\16\\\\ Yet, despite strong encouragement to assimilate into Euro-\\nAmerican culture, Native American people did not completely cease their \\ncultural traditions regarding grassland, forest, and wildlife \\nstewardship. On reservation lands, in keeping with TEK, Native \\nAmericans continued to set some prescribed fires, even though they were \\ndiscouraged from doing so by the U.S. Federal government. On non-Tribal \\nlands, fire exclusion post-Euro-American colonization changed soil \\nbiogeochemical properties significantly, in ways that created plant \\ncommunities far less resilient to drought and other environmental \\nstressors.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\16\\\\ Indian Appropriations Act of Mar. 3, 1871.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) is a fire legacy formed through the thermal \\ndecomposition of organic matter during fires. PyC can increase nutrient \\ncycling in soils and the carbon budget in an ecosystem. PyC is highly \\nstable and can be preserved in mineral soils for decades to centuries. \\nRecent studies have shown that the presence and content of soil PyC \\nexplains a significant amount of variation in soil function (e.g., \\nwater infiltration, carbon microbial cycling, nutrient availability and \\ndynamics).\\\\17\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\17\\\\ Bird 2015; Bowring, et al. 2022.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    The quantity and quality of PyC in soils is related to fire \\nseverity and frequency. Low- and mid-severity fire improves soil \\nproperties and processes, by stimulating nutrient release and \\ndepositing PyC in the topsoil (O and A soil layers, called \\n``horizons''). Low- to mid-severity fire will retain much of the soil \\nseedbank and nutrient capital, simply losing some of the topsoil to \\nvolatilization. After such events, microbial activity rebounds quickly \\nand nutrient availability actually increases. In contrast, the sort of \\nhigh-severity wildfires we have been experiencing globally, linked to \\nclimate change, result in complete combustion of the topsoil, loss of \\nkey species from the seedbank, mortality of shallow plant roots, \\nreduced resprouting of herbs, and loss of carbon and nitrogen from \\nsurface mineral soil.\\\\18\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\18\\\\ DeLuca, et al. 2020; Gao, and DeLuca 2018; Gao, and DeLuca \\n2020; Michelotti, and Miesel 2015; Adkins, and Miesel 2021; Landry, and \\nMatthews 2017; Hart, et al. 1994; Merino, et al. 2019.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Soils on the FBIR and adjacent BLM lands are predominantly \\nmoderately fertile, high-clay soils derived from glacial till.\\\\19\\\\ \\nSurface soils are susceptible to wind erosion and loss of soil organic \\nmatter under conditions of limited vegetative cover. Frequent fire and \\ndeposition of degradation-resistant PyC created a more fertile and \\nhigher tilth soil condition, which is more resilient to drought. On BLM \\nlands, exclusion of fire and decades of heavy grazing pressure by \\ncattle likely led to slow, consistent loss of soil carbon due to \\nmineralization and erosion losses, with only modest returns of fresh \\norganic matter from the resident plant community. Differences in plant \\ncommunity composition also influence ecosystem carbon stocks, with \\nexotic plant species often resulting in a net decline in soil \\ncarbon.\\\\20\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\19\\\\ Hilts 1986.\\n    \\\\20\\\\ Lesica, and DeLuca 1996; Zouhar 2021.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Understanding how different management practices and fire history \\ninfluence soil PyC stock, dynamics, and soil biogeochemical properties \\nat various spatial scales will be of great importance in designing \\nnature-based solutions and strategies to improve the resilience of all \\ngrasslands. To be effective, such solutions must incorporate TEK, \\nincluding ethnobotany.\\\\21\\\\ While soil characterization (e.g., measuring \\nthe depth of the various soil horizons) is part of AIM protocols, in \\n2022 and beyond, we will be taking a more detailed look at soils. It is \\npossible that the difference we observed between BLM and FBIR lands may \\nbe related to the legacy of PyC on FBIR lands, a legacy that as part of \\nTEK cultural burning practices on this grassland created the landscapes \\nand plant communities more resilient to climate change we observed in \\nsummer of 2021. Nevertheless, relationships in the natural world are \\nfar from simple, which Indigenous people have acknowledged since time \\nimmemorial as part of their TEK. We also expect that a variety of site-\\nspecific environmental factors will have bearing on the drought \\nresilience of FBIR and BLM lands.\\\\22\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\21\\\\ Lake 2021; Gann, et al. 2019; Turner 2015.\\n    \\\\22\\\\ Roos, et al. 2018.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Many factors have degraded grasslands and continue to threaten \\nthem, including increasing agricultural development and drought. \\nRestoring grasslands for the ecosystem services they provide is a \\nglobal priority.

During photosynthesis, plants draw carbon dioxide from the \\natmosphere and store it in their leaves, stems, and roots. Unlike \\nforests, grasslands store the majority of their carbon (\\x0b81%) \\nbelowground, in their roots and soil. In fact, the roots of prairie \\ngrasses such as Western wheatgrass often extend belowground as far as \\ntwelve feet. Because most of a grassland's carbon is stored in the \\nsoil, when a grassland burns, it does not release much carbon into the \\natmosphere, the way a forest does when it burns. Additionally, prairie \\ngrasses typically grow as ``bunchgrasses,'' sprouting from near-surface \\nroot crowns or rhizome mats. These grasses are highly adapted to fire, \\nbecause they co-evolved with regular Indigenous cultural burning. When \\nburned lightly, they can resprout within 48 hours, and grow back with \\nincreased vigor.\\n    Overgrazing combined with introduction of exotic species reduces \\nsoil organic matter storage. Our data suggest that BLM lands have a far \\nhigher proportion of exotic species such as crested wheatgrass and \\ncheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) than Tribal lands. Part of this is an \\nartifact of the Homestead Era, during which semi-arid lands in the \\nNorthern Great Plains were settled and developed for agriculture. \\nAttempts to stabilize soils in the 1920s involved planting exotic grass \\nspecies. Many of these lands have not recovered from the ecological \\ndegradation caused by over a decade of drought that culminated in the \\n1930s Dust Bowl. Even with reintroduction of prescribed low-severity \\nfire that replicates Indigenous traditional burning, on BLM lands these \\nexotic species will influence fire behavior and post-fire responses. In \\ngrassland ecosystems comprised primarily of native grass species, with \\na small proportion of exotic species, prescribed burning and mixed-\\nseverity wildfire do not cause a sharp increase (known as an irruption) \\nin exotics. However, as the proportion of exotics increases in a \\nprairie, some, such as cheatgrass, will irrupt in response to fire, \\nout-competing native grass species.\\\\24\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\24\\\\ Briggs, et al. 1995; Strassburg, et al. 2000; Libecap, and \\nHansen. 2002; Ontl, and Janowiak 2017; Dass, et al. 2018; Eisenberg, et \\nal. 2019; Lark, et al. 2020; Nagy, et al. 2021.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    All of this means that as the climate continues to warm and \\nwildfires continue to increase in frequency, size, and severity, \\ngrasslands provide a highly stable and important carbon sink that is \\nmore resilient than forests as a source of carbon. In general, native \\ngrass species, which are perennial, long-lived plants, are the most \\neffective at sequestering carbon. This is because many of the exotic \\nagronomic species, which come from Europe or the Middle East, do not \\ngrow roots as deeply into the soil as North America's native grasses. \\nSince Montana's Northern Great Plains provide a unique combination of \\ngrasses and forbs of high conservation value, establishing and \\nmaintaining a native seed conservation program here that incorporates \\nTEK and ecocultural restoration is crucial to meeting U.S. Federal \\nplant conservation and climate resiliency objectives.\\\\25\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\25\\\\ Lavin, and Seibert 2011.

What programs are needed to ensure this \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nsupply is available to local communities and local landscapes?\\n\\nImportance of Supply of Native Plants and Seeds:\\n\\n    As wildfires and other climate-driven disasters continue to \\ndevastate the U.S., ecological restoration has become a national and \\nglobal priority. Having a stable, economical supply of native plants \\nand seeds is critical to restore ecosystems in the aftermath of these \\ncrises. Currently the availability of native seed of a sufficient range \\nof species and of appropriate genetic provenance for ecological \\nrestoration does not match the need locally, regionally, or nationally. \\nFederal agencies, such as the BLM, U.S. Forest Service (USFS), U.S. \\nFish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), National Park Service (NPS), Tribal \\nnations, and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) are the largest \\npurchasers of native plant seeds in the U.S.\\\\26\\\\ The use of \\ngenetically-appropriate native plants (rather than non-native species \\nor native species from a different locality) in restoration is required \\nor encouraged in policy documents by some agencies, like the NPS and \\nUSFS. BLM policy strongly encourages the use of native plants used for \\nrestoration on federal land, and BLM alone buys hundreds of thousands \\nof pounds of seed annually in response to wildfires.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\26\\\\ National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine \\n2020.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Although BLM and other agencies have large stores of native seeds, \\nand are actively working to increase their supply, large disasters \\ncreate a reactive demand on what is already a limited supply, driving \\nup the cost of native seeds, and in some cases, leading to the use of \\nnon-native species in plantings and seed mixes. State and local \\nauthorities are also users of native seeds, frequently sourcing them \\nfor roadside revegetation, invasive species control, landscape \\nbeautification, soil and water conservation, and pollinator and \\nwildlife habitat restoration. However, these proactive state and local \\nrestoration efforts contend with the same supply chain limitations as \\nthe Federal agencies that dominate the market. This lack of appropriate \\nnative plant material generally strongly constrains ecological \\nrestoration. To that end, there exist several programs which, with \\nadditional support, are well positioned to address this increasing \\nneed, as well as opportunities to create new programs.\\n\\nExisting Programs and Needs:\\n\\n    The BLM Plant Conservation and Restoration Program (PCRP) is \\nworking to ensure that land managers across our nation can buy the \\nnative seed that will work to restore native plant communities that \\nprovide wildlife habitat, ecosystem services, and recreational \\nopportunities for all Americans to enjoy. Seed collection is the first \\nstep in native plant materials development.\\\\27\\\\ Seeds of Success (SOS; \\nhttps://www.blm.gov/programs/natural-resources/native-plant-\\ncommunities/native-plant-and-seed-material-development/collection) is \\nthe national native seed collection program housed under the BLM's \\nPCRP. The mission of SOS is to collect wildland native seed for \\nresearch, development, germplasm conservation, and ecosystem \\nrestoration. Established in 2002, SOS has made over 26,000 seed \\ncollections of over 5,800 unique taxa, from 43 states. Additional SOS \\naccomplishments include:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\27\\\\ Oldfield 2019.\\n\\n    <bullet>  Over 2,500 seed collectors trained in over 140 collecting \\nteams\\n    <bullet>  In 2015, the DOI awarded BLM a $3.5 million grant through \\nthe Hurricane Sandy Supplemental Mitigation Fund for seed collection in \\ncoastal habitats from Virginia to Maine. As of 2018, over 125 SOS East \\ncollections have been used for Hurricane Sandy restoration projects.\\n\\n    To continue the success of the PCRP, we need more:\\n\\n    <bullet>  Botanical Expertise--As of 2021, there were 32 botanists \\nin the BLM. The BLM manages 245 million acres. This means, there is \\nonly one botanist for every 7.656 million acres of public lands.\\n    <bullet>  Restoration Ecologists--As the availability of locally \\nadapted native seed increases, we need restoration practitioners who \\nknow how to best leverage this national investment back onto the \\nlandscape.\\n    <bullet>  Seed cleaning and testing facilities--In the 20 years \\nthat the PCRP has existed, the infrastructure available to clean, test, \\nand store 20 years' worth of seed collections has remained stagnant. \\nMore seed cleaning facilities like the USFS Bend Seed Extractory are \\nneeded for the PCRP and SOS to continue to grow and provide a stable \\nsupply of native seeds for increase and use on public lands.\\n\\n    To address the urgent need for native plant materials for \\nrestoration, the Plant Conservation Alliance Federal Committee (https:/\\n/www.blm.gov/programs/natural-resources/native-plant-communities/\\nnational-seed-strategy/pca), which includes representatives from twelve \\nFederal agencies, developed the National Seed \\nStrategy (NSS; https://www.blm.gov/programs/natural-resources/native-\\nplant-communities/national-seed-strategy). The vision of NSS is to \\nprovide the right seed in the right place at the right time. Successful \\nestablishment and survival of seedlings depends on where and how seeds \\nare collected. Research suggests that it is important to use locally \\nadapted seeds. Local populations often show a home-site advantage and \\nnon-local genotypes may be maladapted to local environmental \\nconditions. Furthermore, intraspecific hybridization of local and non-\\nlocal genotypes may have a negative impact on the genetic structure of \\nlocal populations through mechanisms such as outbreeding depression. \\nAdditionally, many species show a strong, small-scale genetic \\ndifferentiation between different habitats so that matching habitats of \\nthe restoration and donor site can be more significant than minimizing \\ngeographical separation. In sum, locally adapted seeds have a far \\nhigher germination and survival rate, leading to more effective \\necological restoration efforts, than do seeds obtained from other \\ngeographical areas.\\\\28\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\28\\\\ Vander, et al. 2010; Baughman, et al. 2019.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    The mission of NSS is to ensure the availability of appropriate \\nseed to \\nprovide healthy and productive plant communities in a changing climate. \\n\\n2015-2020 NSS accomplishments (https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/\\ndocs/2021-02/NSS%20Progress%202020%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf) include:\\n\\n    <bullet>  17 Federal Agencies, 20+ Tribal Nations, 52 States & \\nTerritories, 380 total partners, $167 million invested\\n    <bullet>  Almost 9,000 seed collections\\n    <bullet>  170+ scientific reports & articles on native seed \\nresearch and development\\n    <bullet>  National Academies of Science national seed needs study \\nunderway\\n    <bullet>  1000s of native seed crops developed by local and \\nregional efforts in over 32 ecoregions\\n    <bullet>  65+ nurseries, farms, growers, and botanic gardens \\nengaged, 21+ regional seed partnerships\\n    <bullet>  2 facilities increased seed storage capacity to 2.1 \\nmillion pounds\\n    <bullet>  250+ types of seed available for large-scale restoration\\n    <bullet>  10+ million acres impacted\\n\\n    Largely because of global warming, wildfires and storms are \\nbecoming increasingly frequent and severe.
